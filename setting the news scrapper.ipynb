         "8 Skills Needed by a Junior Data Scientist",
         "https://www.skillsyouneed.com/rhubarb/junior-data-scientist.html",
         "We'll never share your email address and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSubscribe to our FREE newsletter and start improving your life in just 5 minutes a day.\n\n8 Skills Required for a Junior Data Scientist See also: Problem Solving Skills\n\nAs a junior data scientist, you‚Äôre not expected to possess all the advanced, high-level skills of an experienced professional. After all, everyone has to start somewhere. And data science is one of the most challenging disciplines to build up all the skills required.\n\nNonetheless, a junior data scientist should have a solid set of core competencies. To do the job, whether in a support role or as an analyst for a small business, you should be able to do several key tasks without excessive effort and time.\n\nIn particular, a junior data scientist should have the skills required to competently: build datasets, clean and manipulate data, make data accessible to users, perform advanced analytics, do modeling, present data statistics visually, and align data handling processes with the needs of an organization.\n\nIn terms of developing the skills required for a junior data scientist, what should be the priorities? Let's go through the core competencies you should have to start working in data science.\n\n1. Programming\n\nProgramming is a crucial skill to have for budding junior data scientists. Python, R and SAS are the most popular programming languages for data scientists. Structured Query Language (SQL) is also helpful for data queries and managing relational databases.\n\nA routine part of junior data scientists' job description is to use programming to organize large and often unstructured swathes of data to make analysis possible. You can learn a programming language by pursuing a degree or signing up for an online short course. Once learned, programming is a skill that will help you in many fields, even beyond data science.\n\n2. Statistical Methods\n\nStatistics is a fundamental element of data science. As data engineer Josh Wills once put it, ‚ÄúA data scientist is a person who is better at statistics than any programmer and better at programming than any statistician.‚Äù\n\nAny good course that prepares you to be an applied data scientist will focus attention at some point on statistical methods. Subjects such as Statistical Methods for Data Science and Statistical Inference for Data Scientists are commonly found in Data Science courses.\n\nStatistical methods that data scientists need to know include linear regression, logistic regression and discriminant analysis, bootstrapping and cross-validation, partial least squares, step functions, and clustering.\n\n3. Machine learning\n\nFor data scientists, machine learning is a technique you must understand. Machine learning is used to create predictive models. For example, you can use a machine-learning algorithm to show data from the previous month and estimate how many users you will have next month. Predicting outcomes is an essential part of business analytics, especially in marketing.\n\nYou can start with simple linear models and logistic regression and then move on to more advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost. It is good to know the rules of these algorithms (it only takes 2-3 lines), but the most important thing is to understand how they work. This makes it easier to tune hyperparameters and, ultimately, produce a model with low error rates. To delve deeper into practical applications of machine learning, consider exploring frameworks like LangChain tool use. This powerful tool can help you build sophisticated AI applications.\n\nThe best way to learn machine learning is to practice explaining problems. You can join events such as HackLive, a community leadership community hackathon, where you can learn from the experts while solving the problems and contributing to participating in a hackathon.\n\n4. Data Visualization\n\nPresenting your results graphically is one of the most fun things about data science. Visualization is more of an art than a fixed scene. So, there is no \"one size fits all\" method here. Instead, visual experts know how to create interesting stories.\n\nTo get started, you need to get familiar with common charts like histograms and bar charts and move on to other charts like waterfall charts, temperature charts, and more. These presentations are beneficial when analyzing or showing research data. However, univariate and bivariate analysis is easier to understand using graphic art.\n\nTableau is a popular tool of the trade, used by many, though not all, data science teams. The visual analytics platform provides a smooth interface with drag and drop functionality.\n\n5. Deep Learning\n\nDeep learning, a machine learning method, simulates some of the ways people gain knowledge. You should be familiar with how this works, even as a junior data scientist. To be successful in this field, you should be proficient in programming (preferably Python) and understand linear algebra and math.\n\nYou can start by creating simple models and then move on to other models such as CNNs, RNNs, etc. Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch are must-haves if you're looking for in-depth study.\n\n6. Software Engineering\n\nJunior data scientists with software expertise are in higher demand. They are more self-sufficient in terms of programming skills, making them significantly better equipped to work with data independently.\n\nSome data scientists develop software themselves that can be updated with new data. Others use programming to generate visualizations that can be used by business teams to make decisions. A data scientist with software engineering skills is not constrained by existing data science tools or the capacity of the data analytics team; instead, they can write their own programs.\n\nBecoming a good software engineer without earning a bachelor's, master's, or associate's degree would generally be challenging because of the complexity of the subject and breadth of skills required. Explore industry-aligned courses and programs if you're interested in learning software engineering foundations or adding such skills to start your data science career.\n\n7. Big Data\n\nMaking effective use of Big Data is a key facet of data science. Data volumes are often large and generating insights from datasets effectively presents logistical challenges. Typical big-data tasks for a junior data scientist include predictive modeling, designing segmentation algorithms, recommender systems, and A/B testing frameworks.\n\n8. Data Manipulation and Analysis\n\nAnother important skill for a junior data scientist is data manipulation, which involves cleaning raw data, removing outliers, modifying null values, and converting the data into a more usable format e.g. converting JSON or converting XML to a database, tables, and SQL. Junior data scientists might get faster conclusions by manipulating data elegantly, especially when dealing with enormous amounts of data.\n\nData manipulation and analysis can take a long time, but they will help you make better data-driven judgments in the end. Missing value restoration, outlier correction, adjusting data types, resizing, and transformation are some of the common data manipulation and analysis techniques used."

         "https://365datascience.com/career-advice/career-guides/entry-level-data-scientist/",
         "Join over 2 million students who advanced their careers with 365 Data Science. Learn from instructors who have worked at Meta, Spotify, Google, IKEA, Netflix, and Coca-Cola and master Python, SQL, Excel, machine learning, data analysis, AI fundamentals, and more.\n\nHow to land an entry-level data scientist job?\n\nAs one of the fastest-growing industries over the last decade, data science has become an extremely appealing career path.\n\nThat path, however, needs to start somewhere.\n\nSo, if you are reading this article ‚Äì you‚Äôve got questions. And we are here to give you the answers.\n\nWe‚Äôll go over education, experience, and skills. You'll learn about the importance of networking and making a good impression during the job interview.\n\nFinally, we‚Äôll outline a cohesive plan of the steps you need to take to start your journey as an entry-level data scientist.\n\n(In addition, we've included some extra resources to help you prepare for a successful entry-level data scientist job.)\n\nOf course, all the information is based on empirical research, statements by employers in data science... And a dash of our personal experience. If you re up for learning the brass tracks of ta science, you could watch our course Introduction to Data and Data Science.\n\nLet‚Äôs begin, shall we?\n\nWhat Education Do You Need to Get an Entry-Level Data Scientist Job?\n\nIn previous articles on our blog, we‚Äôve discussed the best degrees for an aspiring entry-level data scientist. To recap: any form of a post-graduate degree in a quantitative field gives you a pretty good chance of success, with Computer Science being the most-represented major.\n\nBesides relevant education, you also need some sort of experience credentials to your name.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the Required Experience to Get an Entry-Level Data Scientist Job?\n\nAccording to our research, roughly 35% of current Data Scientists have already had a job in the same position. And, believe it or not, that‚Äôs actually great news.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it means the remaining 65% had a different occupation prior to that.\n\nTherefore, roughly 2 out of every 3 data scientists are on their first data scientist job in the field.\n\nSo, it‚Äôs safe to say that becoming an entry-level data scientist is a very achievable goal.\n\nHowever, don‚Äôt expect to become a data scientist right after school.\n\nA mere 2% of all data scientists started off with no previous position on their resume. And even this number sounds suspiciously high to us.\n\nSo, regardless of the fact you‚Äôre aiming at an entry-level data scientist position, you still need some previous experience elsewhere.\n\nThis is a testament to how demanding nature of a data scientist position nowadays.\n\nDemanding and hard to get, but not impossible. So‚Ä¶\n\nWhat Are Employers' Entry-Level Data Scientist Requirements?\n\nAccording to employers and recruiters, if you want to succeed in the field, you need to master three things. The tools, the data, and the business.\n\nLet‚Äôs break this down.\n\nThe Tools\n\nKnowing the tools means confidence in working with the most popular software on the market. Those are undoubtedly R or Python, or better yet - both.\n\nWith a bit lower priority but still extremely important are SQL and visualization software, such as PowerBI and Tableau.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that Excel is still a main prerequisite in any job description in the field.\n\nThe Data\n\nTo be a savvy entry-level data scientist, you need to understand where your data is coming from; what are the best ways to process and pre-process it; and most importantly, how to extract actionable insights from it.\n\nThe Business\n\nBefore you apply for a job in a given company, you must find out:\n\nwhich aspects of data science are utilized in the business;\n\nwhat skills are necessary to land a position there.\n\nThat said, having market expertise in the specific field is always a bonus. So, the more holistic your understanding of the data and the industry, the more well-suited you are for the entry-level data scientist position.\n\nWhat Are the Key Entry-Level Data Scientist Skills?\n\nOverall, employers are looking for somebody with high-level coding, statistical, and analytical skills.\n\nBut don‚Äôt worry if you aren‚Äôt a jack-of-all-trades. Usually, to land an entry-level data scientist job you don‚Äôt need to excel in all categories. Being okay in 2 of the 3 is fine‚Ä¶ as long as you‚Äôre great at programming.\n\nOf course, employers are always looking for transferrable skills in a candidate that add value to the company, as well.\n\nTaking initiative, setting challenging goals, and making efforts to exceed them are transferrable skills you should develop.\n\nInterpersonal skills also translate easily across various industries and contexts. So, make sure you got that covered, too.\n\nOther highly appreciated skills in this category include:\n\nthe ability to learn from experience and be the propeller of positive changes;\n\nindependence;\n\nself-direction;\n\nand accountability.\n\nIt's important to have these in your resume. So, make sure you include projects or internships where you worked with others, on top of some evidence of your proficiency in coding.\n\nFor the full list of skills, check our Data Science career guide. And, if you want to learn more about what you should and shouldn‚Äôt include in your resume, check out the 365 Data Science Resume Guide.\n\nWhy Is Networking Important to Get an Entry-Level Data Scientist Job?\n\nIn highly competitive fields, such as Data Science, who you know could be just as important as what you know. This is especially true when you‚Äôre trying to break into the field. So, do your best to find somebody who is willing to give you a chance, even at a Junior position. Getting a recommendation from your previous boss, or a referral from an employee of the company you are currently applying at, is a sure-fire way to boosting your chances of getting hired.\n\nAnd the tried and tested way of getting these is through networking.\n\nOne good approach is to use Handshake and similar sites, where alumni from your school post job ads.\n\nThis way, you can find interesting potential employers who you want to interact with. Drop them an e-mail; ask them for an informational interview; give them your details; ask specific questions about what their company does. By doing so, you‚Äôre making a solid good impression because:\n\nA) you know or you want to learn the business, and\n\nB) you‚Äôve done your research.\n\nSometimes, you won‚Äôt be able to get direct contact information through the website. In such cases, you can check out your school‚Äôs alumni directory. You should be able to find at least an e-mail, a phone number or a LinkedIn profile. And all you have to do next is reach out.\n\nAlternatively, you can meet people in the field by going to local conferences or lectures about Data Science.\n\nUniversities and colleges frequently organize events of the sort. And they're often open to the general public. In addition, independent Data Science societies also sponsor or organize control-group meetups where they discuss the applications of D-S in specific fields ‚Äì like medicine or finance, for example.\n\nJust remember, the more invested you look, the higher the chance that these people would want to keep in touch. So, try to stay enthusiastic and curious.\n\nOf course, knowing the right people will get you far. However, in most cases, it won‚Äôt get you the job.\n\nEven with a referral or recommendation, you still have to go through a job interview.\n\nHow to Win the Entry Level Data Scientist Job Interview?\n\nYour potential employers can always test your statistical skills with a written exam and your programming skills with a remote task.\n\nBut the face-to-face interview is where you present your coherent communication skills.\n\nSo, make sure you highlight them in the best possible way.\n\nOf course, data science incorporates multi-disciplinary aspects of various fields. And it can be challenging to prepare for everything.\n\nThat is why we created a practical guide on Data Science Interview Questions and Answers. Think of this as our data science equivalent to ‚ÄúCracking the Code‚Äù, albeit a little bit smaller. Once you read it, you‚Äôll have all the knowledge and tools to succeed during the interview.\n\nTake Your Interview Prep to the Next Level!\n\nTry our AI-powered interview simulator!

         "Starting your career as an entry-level data scientist is an exciting opportunity, but it also comes with its fair share of technical and professional challenges. These challenges are essential for you to recognize your ability and navigate the office environment before progressing to a role with more responsibilities. Some of these include:\n\nManaging Expectations\n\nFor instance, your manager may expect a deep learning model to be developed and deployed in two weeks. As an entry-level data scientist, you might confidently agree to the timeline.\n\nHowever, as you delve into the project, due to inexperience, you may encounter complex data preprocessing issues and difficulties with hyperparameter tuning‚Äîstretching the initial timeline and revealing your misjudgment.\n\nClear communication with your manager often resolves issues. Make sure their expectations are realistic early on.\n\nBalancing Theory and Practical\n\nThere‚Äôs often a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in a business context. For example, we learn that linear regression assumes a linear relationship. However, when applying it to real-world data, it often performs poorly due to non-linear relationships.\n\nFocus on applying theory to real-world problems while preparing for the interview, and learn from mistakes. Engage in projects that allow you to bridge this gap and gain practical experience.\n\nData Cleaning and Preprocessing\n\nRaw data is often messy, incomplete, and inconsistent. Cleaning and preprocessing the data can be time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the data, which you may not yet have as an entry-level data scientist.\n\nDevelop strong skills in data wrangling and become proficient in tools and libraries like pandas in Python. However, a practical understanding of the domain is more critical for making informed decisions about handling raw data than theoretical practices.\n\nSelecting the Right Model\n\nWith many ML algorithms and models to choose from, it can be challenging to select the right one for a given problem. Gain a solid understanding of different machine learning algorithms, their assumptions, and their appropriate use cases.\n\nJunior data scientists, for instance, often choose a complex neural network model to predict customer churn, thinking it will yield the best results. However, after struggling with overfitting and long training times, they often switch to a simpler logistic regression model, which performs better and is easier to interpret.\n\nHandling Large Datasets\n\nThe large datasets you worked with during preparation will feel small compared to the vast data lakes you‚Äôll encounter in a real data science job. Moreover, working with those huge datasets can be computationally expensive and slow, especially if you‚Äôre not familiar with optimization techniques. Learn about efficient data handling techniques, such as using vectorized operations, batching, and leveraging distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask.\n\nCollaborating and Communication\n\nOne of our candidates, a data science intern, was tasked with helping the marketing team on a customer segmentation project. Excited to showcase their skills, they built a complex clustering model without regularly consulting the team. When they finally presented the results, the segments were too abstract and didn‚Äôt align with the team‚Äôs needs.\n\nCollaborating with engineers, product managers, and other stakeholders requires effective communication and teamwork, which can be challenging if you‚Äôre not used to it.\n\nDevelop strong interpersonal skills, be open to feedback, and learn to communicate your ideas effectively. Understanding the perspectives and needs of other team members can lead to better collaboration."
