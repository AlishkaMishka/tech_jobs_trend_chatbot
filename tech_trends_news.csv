8 Skills Required for a Junior Data Scientist See also: Problem Solving Skills

As a junior data scientist, you’re not expected to possess all the advanced, high-level skills of an experienced professional. After all, everyone has to start somewhere. And data science is one of the most challenging disciplines to build up all the skills required.

Nonetheless, a junior data scientist should have a solid set of core competencies. To do the job, whether in a support role or as an analyst for a small business, you should be able to do several key tasks without excessive effort and time.

In particular, a junior data scientist should have the skills required to competently: build datasets, clean and manipulate data, make data accessible to users, perform advanced analytics, do modeling, present data statistics visually, and align data handling processes with the needs of an organization.

In terms of developing the skills required for a junior data scientist, what should be the priorities? Let's go through the core competencies you should have to start working in data science.

1. Programming

Programming is a crucial skill to have for budding junior data scientists. Python, R and SAS are the most popular programming languages for data scientists. Structured Query Language (SQL) is also helpful for data queries and managing relational databases.

A routine part of junior data scientists' job description is to use programming to organize large and often unstructured swathes of data to make analysis possible. You can learn a programming language by pursuing a degree or signing up for an online short course. Once learned, programming is a skill that will help you in many fields, even beyond data science.

2. Statistical Methods

Statistics is a fundamental element of data science. As data engineer Josh Wills once put it, “A data scientist is a person who is better at statistics than any programmer and better at programming than any statistician.”

Any good course that prepares you to be an applied data scientist will focus attention at some point on statistical methods. Subjects such as Statistical Methods for Data Science and Statistical Inference for Data Scientists are commonly found in Data Science courses.

Statistical methods that data scientists need to know include linear regression, logistic regression and discriminant analysis, bootstrapping and cross-validation, partial least squares, step functions, and clustering.

3. Machine learning

For data scientists, machine learning is a technique you must understand. Machine learning is used to create predictive models. For example, you can use a machine-learning algorithm to show data from the previous month and estimate how many users you will have next month. Predicting outcomes is an essential part of business analytics, especially in marketing.

You can start with simple linear models and logistic regression and then move on to more advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost. It is good to know the rules of these algorithms (it only takes 2-3 lines), but the most important thing is to understand how they work. This makes it easier to tune hyperparameters and, ultimately, produce a model with low error rates. To delve deeper into practical applications of machine learning, consider exploring frameworks like LangChain tool use. This powerful tool can help you build sophisticated AI applications.

The best way to learn machine learning is to practice explaining problems. You can join events such as HackLive, a community leadership community hackathon, where you can learn from the experts while solving the problems and contributing to participating in a hackathon.

4. Data Visualization

Presenting your results graphically is one of the most fun things about data science. Visualization is more of an art than a fixed scene. So, there is no ""one size fits all"" method here. Instead, visual experts know how to create interesting stories.

To get started, you need to get familiar with common charts like histograms and bar charts and move on to other charts like waterfall charts, temperature charts, and more. These presentations are beneficial when analyzing or showing research data. However, univariate and bivariate analysis is easier to understand using graphic art.

Tableau is a popular tool of the trade, used by many, though not all, data science teams. The visual analytics platform provides a smooth interface with drag and drop functionality.

5. Deep Learning

Deep learning, a machine learning method, simulates some of the ways people gain knowledge. You should be familiar with how this works, even as a junior data scientist. To be successful in this field, you should be proficient in programming (preferably Python) and understand linear algebra and math.

You can start by creating simple models and then move on to other models such as CNNs, RNNs, etc. Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch are must-haves if you're looking for in-depth study.

6. Software Engineering

Junior data scientists with software expertise are in higher demand. They are more self-sufficient in terms of programming skills, making them significantly better equipped to work with data independently.

Some data scientists develop software themselves that can be updated with new data. Others use programming to generate visualizations that can be used by business teams to make decisions. A data scientist with software engineering skills is not constrained by existing data science tools or the capacity of the data analytics team; instead, they can write their own programs.

Becoming a good software engineer without earning a bachelor's, master's, or associate's degree would generally be challenging because of the complexity of the subject and breadth of skills required. Explore industry-aligned courses and programs if you're interested in learning software engineering foundations or adding such skills to start your data science career.

7. Big Data

Making effective use of Big Data is a key facet of data science. Data volumes are often large and generating insights from datasets effectively presents logistical challenges. Typical big-data tasks for a junior data scientist include predictive modeling, designing segmentation algorithms, recommender systems, and A/B testing frameworks.

8. Data Manipulation and Analysis

Another important skill for a junior data scientist is data manipulation, which involves cleaning raw data, removing outliers, modifying null values, and converting the data into a more usable format e.g. converting JSON or converting XML to a database, tables, and SQL. Junior data scientists might get faster conclusions by manipulating data elegantly, especially when dealing with enormous amounts of data.

Data manipulation and analysis can take a long time, but they will help you make better data-driven judgments in the end. Missing value restoration, outlier correction, adjusting data types, resizing, and transformation are some of the common data manipulation and analysis techniques used."

How to land an entry-level data scientist job?

As one of the fastest-growing industries over the last decade, data science has become an extremely appealing career path.

That path, however, needs to start somewhere.

So, if you are reading this article – you’ve got questions. And we are here to give you the answers.

We’ll go over education, experience, and skills. You'll learn about the importance of networking and making a good impression during the job interview.

Finally, we’ll outline a cohesive plan of the steps you need to take to start your journey as an entry-level data scientist.

(In addition, we've included some extra resources to help you prepare for a successful entry-level data scientist job.)

Of course, all the information is based on empirical research, statements by employers in data science... And a dash of our personal experience. If you re up for learning the brass tracks of ta science, you could watch our course Introduction to Data and Data Science.

Let’s begin, shall we?

What Education Do You Need to Get an Entry-Level Data Scientist Job?

In previous articles on our blog, we’ve discussed the best degrees for an aspiring entry-level data scientist. To recap: any form of a post-graduate degree in a quantitative field gives you a pretty good chance of success, with Computer Science being the most-represented major.

Besides relevant education, you also need some sort of experience credentials to your name.

What’s the Required Experience to Get an Entry-Level Data Scientist Job?

According to our research, roughly 35% of current Data Scientists have already had a job in the same position. And, believe it or not, that’s actually great news.

Why?

Because it means the remaining 65% had a different occupation prior to that.

Therefore, roughly 2 out of every 3 data scientists are on their first data scientist job in the field.

So, it’s safe to say that becoming an entry-level data scientist is a very achievable goal.

However, don’t expect to become a data scientist right after school.

A mere 2% of all data scientists started off with no previous position on their resume. And even this number sounds suspiciously high to us.

So, regardless of the fact you’re aiming at an entry-level data scientist position, you still need some previous experience elsewhere.

This is a testament to how demanding nature of a data scientist position nowadays.

Demanding and hard to get, but not impossible. So…

What Are Employers' Entry-Level Data Scientist Requirements?

According to employers and recruiters, if you want to succeed in the field, you need to master three things. The tools, the data, and the business.

Let’s break this down.

The Tools

Knowing the tools means confidence in working with the most popular software on the market. Those are undoubtedly R or Python, or better yet - both.

With a bit lower priority but still extremely important are SQL and visualization software, such as PowerBI and Tableau.

Finally, it is important to note that Excel is still a main prerequisite in any job description in the field.

The Data

To be a savvy entry-level data scientist, you need to understand where your data is coming from; what are the best ways to process and pre-process it; and most importantly, how to extract actionable insights from it.

The Business

Before you apply for a job in a given company, you must find out:

which aspects of data science are utilized in the business;

what skills are necessary to land a position there.

That said, having market expertise in the specific field is always a bonus. So, the more holistic your understanding of the data and the industry, the more well-suited you are for the entry-level data scientist position.

What Are the Key Entry-Level Data Scientist Skills?

Overall, employers are looking for somebody with high-level coding, statistical, and analytical skills.

But don’t worry if you aren’t a jack-of-all-trades. Usually, to land an entry-level data scientist job you don’t need to excel in all categories. Being okay in 2 of the 3 is fine… as long as you’re great at programming.

Of course, employers are always looking for transferrable skills in a candidate that add value to the company, as well.

Taking initiative, setting challenging goals, and making efforts to exceed them are transferrable skills you should develop.

Interpersonal skills also translate easily across various industries and contexts. So, make sure you got that covered, too.

Other highly appreciated skills in this category include:

the ability to learn from experience and be the propeller of positive changes;

independence;

self-direction;

and accountability.

It's important to have these in your resume. So, make sure you include projects or internships where you worked with others, on top of some evidence of your proficiency in coding.

For the full list of skills, check our Data Science career guide. And, if you want to learn more about what you should and shouldn’t include in your resume, check out the 365 Data Science Resume Guide.

Why Is Networking Important to Get an Entry-Level Data Scientist Job?

In highly competitive fields, such as Data Science, who you know could be just as important as what you know. This is especially true when you’re trying to break into the field. So, do your best to find somebody who is willing to give you a chance, even at a Junior position. Getting a recommendation from your previous boss, or a referral from an employee of the company you are currently applying at, is a sure-fire way to boosting your chances of getting hired.

And the tried and tested way of getting these is through networking.

One good approach is to use Handshake and similar sites, where alumni from your school post job ads.

This way, you can find interesting potential employers who you want to interact with. Drop them an e-mail; ask them for an informational interview; give them your details; ask specific questions about what their company does. By doing so, you’re making a solid good impression because:

A) you know or you want to learn the business, and

B) you’ve done your research.

Sometimes, you won’t be able to get direct contact information through the website. In such cases, you can check out your school’s alumni directory. You should be able to find at least an e-mail, a phone number or a LinkedIn profile. And all you have to do next is reach out.

Alternatively, you can meet people in the field by going to local conferences or lectures about Data Science.

Universities and colleges frequently organize events of the sort. And they're often open to the general public. In addition, independent Data Science societies also sponsor or organize control-group meetups where they discuss the applications of D-S in specific fields – like medicine or finance, for example.

Just remember, the more invested you look, the higher the chance that these people would want to keep in touch. So, try to stay enthusiastic and curious.

Of course, knowing the right people will get you far. However, in most cases, it won’t get you the job.

Even with a referral or recommendation, you still have to go through a job interview.

How to Win the Entry Level Data Scientist Job Interview?

Your potential employers can always test your statistical skills with a written exam and your programming skills with a remote task.

But the face-to-face interview is where you present your coherent communication skills.

So, make sure you highlight them in the best possible way.

Of course, data science incorporates multi-disciplinary aspects of various fields. And it can be challenging to prepare for everything.

That is why we created a practical guide on Data Science Interview Questions and Answers. Think of this as our data science equivalent to “Cracking the Code”, albeit a little bit smaller. Once you read it, you’ll have all the knowledge and tools to succeed during the interview.

"(""entry-level data science"" OR ""junior data scientist"" OR ""data science intern"") AND (""skills"" OR ""requirements"" OR ""career advice"")",Entry Level Data Science Jobs: What to Expect and How to Get Started (Updated for 2025),https://www.interviewquery.com/p/entry-level-data-scientist,"Starting your career as an entry-level data scientist is an exciting opportunity, but it also comes with its fair share of technical and professional challenges. These challenges are essential for you to recognize your ability and navigate the office environment before progressing to a role with more responsibilities. Some of these include:

Managing Expectations

For instance, your manager may expect a deep learning model to be developed and deployed in two weeks. As an entry-level data scientist, you might confidently agree to the timeline.

However, as you delve into the project, due to inexperience, you may encounter complex data preprocessing issues and difficulties with hyperparameter tuning—stretching the initial timeline and revealing your misjudgment.

Clear communication with your manager often resolves issues. Make sure their expectations are realistic early on.

Balancing Theory and Practical

There’s often a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in a business context. For example, we learn that linear regression assumes a linear relationship. However, when applying it to real-world data, it often performs poorly due to non-linear relationships.

Focus on applying theory to real-world problems while preparing for the interview, and learn from mistakes. Engage in projects that allow you to bridge this gap and gain practical experience.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Raw data is often messy, incomplete, and inconsistent. Cleaning and preprocessing the data can be time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the data, which you may not yet have as an entry-level data scientist.

Develop strong skills in data wrangling and become proficient in tools and libraries like pandas in Python. However, a practical understanding of the domain is more critical for making informed decisions about handling raw data than theoretical practices.

Selecting the Right Model

With many ML algorithms and models to choose from, it can be challenging to select the right one for a given problem. Gain a solid understanding of different machine learning algorithms, their assumptions, and their appropriate use cases.

Junior data scientists, for instance, often choose a complex neural network model to predict customer churn, thinking it will yield the best results. However, after struggling with overfitting and long training times, they often switch to a simpler logistic regression model, which performs better and is easier to interpret.

Handling Large Datasets

The large datasets you worked with during preparation will feel small compared to the vast data lakes you’ll encounter in a real data science job. Moreover, working with those huge datasets can be computationally expensive and slow, especially if you’re not familiar with optimization techniques. Learn about efficient data handling techniques, such as using vectorized operations, batching, and leveraging distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask.

Collaborating and Communication

One of our candidates, a data science intern, was tasked with helping the marketing team on a customer segmentation project. Excited to showcase their skills, they built a complex clustering model without regularly consulting the team. When they finally presented the results, the segments were too abstract and didn’t align with the team’s needs.

Collaborating with engineers, product managers, and other stakeholders requires effective communication and teamwork, which can be challenging if you’re not used to it.

Develop strong interpersonal skills, be open to feedback, and learn to communicate your ideas effectively. Understanding the perspectives and needs of other team members can lead to better collaboration."

What to Expect as a Data Science Intern

Data science internships are a unique opportunity for those who wish to gain hands-on experience working with data at a fast-growing company.

Many students and recent graduates have difficulties entering their first job because they’re not used to working with messier and more complex data than they experienced while studying.

Why does that happen? As a student, many of the datasets you encounter are carefully preprocessed by the course instructor—so they’re cleaner than actual real-world ones. This is one of the benefits of taking an internship: to learn how to manage messy data.

Those who have just entered the field have high expectations about the job. Still, it’s improbable that you’ll be tasked with creating a machine learning algorithm immediately because 90% of machine learning is preprocessing, and 10% is modeling.

To summarize, expect messy, raw data and all that comes with this alluring chaos—i.e., the hands-on experience and unparalleled exposure to skilled data scientists that will help you along the way.

As an intern, you’ll be on a team of professionals who solve business problems to create value. We’ve mentioned machine learning, but a more probable workload scenario would involve the following:

Conducting analyses

Producing reports

Building creative data visualizations

Molding data into a narrative

You’ll be asked to devise metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, and tackle hard, open-ended problems.

This might sound overwhelming for the novice data scientist, but you won’t be alone. You’ll work closely with engineers, product designers, and product managers who will offer support and guide you through the internship.

How to Get a Data Science Internship: Next Steps

The benefits of a data science internship are countless—from working with professionals in the field to building your portfolio and receiving excellent mentorship and networking opportunities. You’ll learn from professional data scientists and demonstrate you’re one step ahead of your peers.

As companies in almost every industry continue leveraging data-driven decision making, data scientists will stay in high demand, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasting 21% headcount growth in the field by 2031, over four times the growth it projects for all occupations.

Given this data, it’s easy to think that data science jobs are simply there for the taking, but the reality is more complicated. Skilled data scientists, after all, can demand handsome salaries: $138,780 on average in the US, more than twice the median household income of $67,521 .

With so much money up for grabs, competition for data science jobs is fierce: nobody’s just waltzing into one of these positions. So how do you land a data scientist role these days? In this article, we’ll dive in with a step-by-step guide that you can follow to get started down your data science career path. Even better, this guide will work for the aspiring data analyst, data engineer, business analyst, data architect, or any of a number of data-centered jobs.

What is data science?

Before diving in, let's review the fundamental concept of data science. According to IBM , data science involves applying a multidisciplinary approach to extract valuable insights from large and constantly increasing volumes of data generated by modern organizations. This includes organizing and processing data for analysis, conducting advanced data analysis using machine learning algorithms and models, and presenting results through data visualization to reveal patterns and help stakeholders make informed decisions.

In the role of a data scientist, you will follow the data pipeline, which involves:

Defining research interests and questions,

Structuring unstructured data (or ""raw data"") for use,

Analyzing the data,

Communicating findings effectively through data visualization tools.

There are also several other positions within or related to data science that focus on using data to achieve business objectives, such as:

Data Analyst

Data analyst is an extremely broad title — so the day-to-day of two data analysts at different companies might look very different. Typically, however, a data analyst gathers data and readies it for analysis, and then analyzes it to yield business insights that the analyst will then communicate to relevant stakeholders, often through data visualizations. Though there is some overlap between the responsibilities of a data scientist and a data analyst, data scientists are usually more concerned with creating new techniques, tools, and processes for data analysis, while data analysts more often use existing techniques, tools, and processes. Check out our article which dives deeper on the topic of becoming a data analyst.

According to Salary.com, in the US the average data analyst salary is $81,719.

Business Intelligence Analyst

There’s certainly lots of overlap between a data analyst and a business intelligence analyst. Indeed, sometimes it just comes down to what title a company gives a position. But, in theory at least, what sets a BI analyst apart? According to Indeed , a business intelligence analyst — or, sometimes just “business analyst” — is more narrowly focused than a data analyst on the metrics, sometimes called “key performance indicators” (KPIs), that can be used to evaluate a company’s performance. By definition, business intelligence focuses on the past, while the umbrella field of data analytics can include areas like prescriptive and predictive analytics that focus on future activity.

According to Salary.com, in the US the average business intelligence analyst salary is $84,803.

Data Architect

A data architect designs efficient pathways, protocols, and systems for data collection, preparation, and storage according to a business’ specific needs, capacity and resources.

According to Salary.com, in the US the average data architect salary is $124,771.

Data Engineer

Data engineers and data architects are commonly confused, but the distinction is actually quite simple. While a data architect designs efficient pathways, protocols, and systems — plans them out — a data engineer focuses on creating them.

According to Salary.com, in the US the average data engineer salary is $112,555.

How to get a job in data science

Now that we’ve reviewed what exactly data science is and the different careers included in and adjacent to data science, let’s get down to how you can start yourself down a data science career path.

Step One: Get educated.

The first, and most important, step towards landing a data science job is learning core data science skills , both the technical skills that will help you deal with the data and the soft skills that will help you derive and communicate insights from it.

Data Science Skills

Data science skills include the following:

Applied mathematics: Probability, statistics, and linear algebra are crucial both for statistical analyses and for developing machine learning models.

Programming: Programming skills, including fluency in programming languages like SQL, R, and Python, are essential to be able to access data and perform advanced analytics.

Statistical analysis: Skill performing statistical analyses such as linear regression is required to turn raw data into actionable insights.

Machine learning: The ability to write machine learning (and especially deep learning) algorithms and models allows data scientists to more efficiently and effectively separate signal from noise, especially when dealing with big data sets.

Data management: Before they can even begin analysis, data scientists need to employ skills in data collection (including data mining), data cleansing, and database management.

Data visualization: A core component of communicating new business insights derived from data is data visualization, usually using software like Tableau.

Soft skills: What sets the great data scientists apart from the good ones, especially later on in their careers, are core soft skills like communication, leadership, and critical thinking.

If you’re an aspiring data scientist looking to start building out your skill sets, there’s an abundance of options depending on your particular background.

Data Science Bachelor’s Degree Programs

Who?

Aspiring data scientists willing to spend the time and money on a four-year degree

What?

A data science bachelor’s curriculum will cover all the essential skills we noted above, though for more advanced areas like deep learning the instruction will be fairly minimal.

Why?

Data science bachelor’s degrees offer the surest path to a data science job for those without existing experience.

How much?

Tuition for bachelor’s degree programs can vary widely, especially between in-state tuition at public universities and tuition at elite private universities.

In general, undergraduates can expect to spend between $10,000 and $60,000 on tuition per year before living expenses.

Data Science Bootcamps

Who?

Those looking to get into data science who 1) don’t want to pursue traditional degrees and 2) want to study online

What?

Students can expect to cover much of the same material in a data science bootcamp as someone in a bachelor’s program, though in much less time and thus in much less detail.

Fundamental skills in mathematics are generally taught through self-directed preliminary courses required to be completed before beginning the bootcamp.

Bootcamps will also usually offer 1:1 mentoring or other career services and emphasize independent projects that students can use to start their data science portfolios.

Why?

Because they are online, bootcamps are shorter, cheaper, and more flexible than traditional degrees, while still providing a feasible path to a data science career.

How much?

Bootcamp tuition varies drastically depending on what organization is offering the program. It’s not uncommon for three-month, full-time programs to cost upwards of $15,000, though part-time, more self-directed bootcamps can cost considerably less.

Some bootcamps offer financing, installment plans, or income-share plans where you pay back a fraction of your income once you get a job.

Other bootcamps have guarantees that you will get a job offer or you get your money back.

What next?

If you’re interested in learning more about data science bootcamps, you can check out our guide (or our deep dive on online bootcamps) where we have recommendations for programs that will get you started on your own data science career path.

Data Science Certificates and Other Short Courses

Who?

Those looking to get into data science who don’t want to commit to a bootcamp or who already have some relevant skills.

What?

Data science certificate and other short courses will either give a broad overview of data science without diving too much into the details or will focus only on one aspect or skill, such as coding with Python or data visualization.

Why?

Non-bootcamp certificate programs and other short courses allow for more targeted, flexible, or bespoke instruction than a bootcamp could offer. This is especially useful for someone who already has some relevant experience working with data.

Certificates can be displayed on a resume or LinkedIn to communicate your expertise to recruiters.

How much?

Generally these options are less expensive than bootcamps, with tuition ranging from free to a couple thousand dollars.

Some online learning providers like DataCamp offer training for a flat monthly fee.

What next?

If you’re interested in learning more about data science certificates and other short courses, check out our guide for more information and recommendations.

Data Science Master’s Degree Programs

Who?

Individuals who already hold bachelor’s degrees in STEM disciplines or who are able to show aptitude or existing ability in programming and applied mathematics.

What?

The curriculum of a data science master’s degree will resemble that of a data science bachelor’s degree to an extent, but generally courses will be more advanced, with fundamentals either not offered or required to be completed in advance of beginning the degree proper.

Why?

Master’s-level study provides more advanced data science training and can unlock higher salaries than either bachelor’s programs or bootcamps.

While universities frequently offer full-time in-person master’s programs, there are more and more part-time and online master's in data science program options for students looking for the flexibility to continue working or care for a loved one while they study — the best of both worlds.

How much?

Tuition for data science master’s programs can vary widely, not only because of the difference between public university in-state tuition and private university tuition, but also because of the availability of online and part-time programs.

Graduate students can still expect to spend between $10,000 and $60,000 on tuition per year before living expenses.

What next?

Our guide to data science master’s programs has lots of useful information for those interested in graduate study in data science.

Step Two: Get experienced.

While education can help you learn the skills needed to succeed in data science, most employers want job candidates to also have real-world experience, even for entry-level positions. There are several different ways you can begin building this experience.

Internships

If you choose to pursue a traditional bachelor’s or master’s degree, it’s a good idea to do one or more internships during your summers off. Many times, a degree program will have existing industry connections through which they can place their students in internships. You can also find internships posted on company career pages and on LinkedIn, Indeed, and other job boards.

Independent or Collaborative Projects

Even if you have an internship on your resume, it’s a good idea to supplement this experience with a portfolio of data science projects that show off your abilities and interests, often hosted on GitHub or a personal website. Most bachelor’s, master’s, and bootcamp programs will lead students through the process of designing and executing an independent project, and once you learn this process you can go off on your own — the sky’s really the limit. Increasingly, aspiring data scientists are teaming up with others from around the world on open-source projects like those offered by Spotify . Working on one of these projects offers not only great training, but an opportunity to network.

Freelancing and Pro Bono Work

Another way to build experience is through freelancing, though if you are brand new in data science it can be difficult to land your first gig. In this case, you might consider doing pro bono work through a social-good outfit like DataKind , Catchafire , or Statistics Without Borders . While you won’t get paid for this work, oftentimes you’ll be allowed to showcase any work product in your portfolio.

Practice Problems

If you want to practice your skills in a stress-free environment, there are loads of practice problems available for free online to keep you sharp. This is particularly the case for Python: resources like Practice Python , Real Python , and PyNative can help you gain fluency and work towards acing interview coding tests.

Join a Data Science Club or Organization

Many universities and communities have data science clubs or organizations that offer opportunities to work on projects and participate in hackathons and other events. These organizations can provide a supportive learning environment and a chance to network with other data science enthusiasts. Notable examples are Women in Data Science (WiDS), a global organization that hosts conferences and events focused on the advancement of women in data science and related fields, and the Association of Data Scientists (ADaSci), a professional organization that brings together data scientists from various industries and provides networking opportunities, educational resources, and events to help members advance their careers.

Step Three: Get polished.

Once you have the skills and experience, it’s important to make sure you’re showcasing them in the best way possible. This will not only help you land a job, but will be good training for the kind of persuasive storytelling you’ll have to do as a data scientist. In addition to your portfolio, which we’ve already mentioned, you’ll want to make sure to have an up-to-date, polished resume and practice your interviewing skills.

Remember, when you apply for a job, you’re applying to play a specific role as part of a team, so for each job you apply for you’ll want to tweak your resume accordingly and practice answering why you want to work there and why you’d be a good fit.

For more, check out our data science resume and interview tips.

Step Four: Get busy.

So you have what you need to perform well on the job and you can demonstrate this to an interviewer — how do you land your first interview? While your first impulse might be to apply widely — and you should certainly apply to many different places — you should also leverage your professional network to develop some leads as you go about your job search. Oftentimes, a connection from a fellow alumnus or alumna or a family friend is all you need to make sure your resume gets read and you get an interview.

Once you land an interview, be ready for a protracted process: you will likely have to pass several different interview rounds before you get a job offer. Oftentimes, this will involve speaking to potential co-workers at varying levels of seniority, and you will likely also be asked to complete a take-home project so that they can assess your skills and fit for the role.

But just in case you wish to go straight to the parts that interest you most, you can use the navigation below.

Data Science Career Guide

Why is data science a good career to explore?

Advancements in technology helped data science evolve from cleaning datasets and applying statistical methods to a field that encompasses data analysis, predictive analytics, data mining, business intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and so much more. Now, there still might be some who think that data science is just a trend and the hype around it will eventually go away. Of course, nothing could be farther from reality. The truth is, data science is just gaining speed as all businesses (and government organizations) use enormous volumes of data to improve what they do and how they do it. But what makes data science the magic ingredient for success? Here are two tangible examples.

Formula 1

The Brazilian Grand Prix 2012. Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel suffers the worst possible start, his car spinning out of control and losing its front wing on his opening lap. Vettel suddenly drops down to last. All seems doomed for the champion. However, the German somehow manages to recover and finish sixth, which grants him just enough points to snatch the world title for the third year in a row in the most dramatic fashion. Fierce driving or luck?

Nope. That’s data science.

Turns out, by the time Vettel made it to his 10-th lap pit stop, a team of brilliant data engineers had already used modeled data to run simulations. Thus, they were able to analyze what adjustments were necessary to keep Sebastian’s Renault going for the remaining 70 laps. What a huge victory fueled by data!

Caesars Casino

Caesars Entertainment Corporation was the fourth-largest gaming company in the world in 2013, with annual revenues of $8.6 billion. Based in Nevada, US, it runs more than 50 hotels and casinos around the world, some of them at the most lucrative locations in Las Vegas.

But do you know what Caesar’s most valuable asset is?

It’s their database, giving indispensable insight into 45 million hotel and casino customers’ behavior and spending patterns.

The corporation used 17 years of gathering information to build “an automated, targeted marketing strategy for every individual customer, using data to understand who they are, and then predictive modeling to assess the best way to incentivize them to spend money.” (Marr, 2016)

What does this mean in practice?

Well, if you’re a client with a high lifetime value that happens to have lost all their luck, dignity, and money at the Blackjack table, you’ll most certainly be approached by a staff member. They’ll immediately lift your spirits by serving you your favorite drink. Or they’ll hand you free tickets to an evening entertainment program, and even offer you other free perks they know your heart desires. That way, Ceasar makes sure you’re happy and satisfied and keeps you coming back for more.

Why is data science important?

So, what type of data scientist would you like to be? Here are 3 top industries consider:

Finance and Insurance

Finance and Insurance is, in fact, the industry with the highest demand for unique data science and analytics talent. But what distinguishes a financial data scientist? Their experience and financial domain knowledge. So, if you want to earn the title financial data scientist, you should definitely be in-the-know about financial markets, portfolio management, risk analysis, profitability, delinquency, and closure, among other concepts. Now, you have to keep in mind that this is not a job you land without a few years of experience in the field. However, if you start as a financial analyst, study hard, and keep your eyes on the prize, you can certainly work your way up to the coveted financial data scientist position.

So many people want to start a career in data science, but struggle to make that first step.

And I won’t lie, it is a hard step.

You are battling against companies and recruiters always wanting candidates with experience, while you are looking for your chance to start building industry experience. So – what are you to do?

While I can’t guarantee you success, I can give you a process to follow to try and maximize your chances of getting your first data science job. It is a process I used myself when I was first getting into the field and also contains vital steps that I have found others utilize to make their first step. I hope these 5 steps can at least help you feel like you are making real progress and moving towards your goal of landing your first data science job.

What Type of Role Are you Looking For?

Image by Author

One of the challenges with data science is it really isn’t one field, it is a field that consists of many different types of jobs. It is important when starting out to think about what type of role you would like and at what type of company. There are 3 pretty common roles I see:

Analyst – generally focused on creating actionable intelligence from data. This can often be through dashboards, reporting, statistics, and data mining.

Data Scientist – usually creates predictive models that should generate value for the company. For example, a data scientist could create a model to predict which customers will churn.

Research Scientist – focused on moving the state-of-the-art forward. Typically, would be doing research and publishing papers at conferences.

Spend some time doing deeper research on these roles and potentially other roles you see in the data science field. Finding a job will become much easier if you can narrow down what role you would like to pursue. For example, if you decide you want to be a research scientist, the skills and experiences you need are significantly different from say an analyst.

Also, different roles can be harder to obtain. I tend to find that Analyst roles are the easiest, then data science, and finally research scientist roles. This is mostly because of the demand for these roles. Pretty much every company hires analysts in some form these days, while not many hire actual research scientists.

After thinking about the type of role, now consider the type of company you want to work at. There are many axes upon which you can think about companies. For example, size, industry, and geographic location are a few. The type of company is important because different types of companies hire data roles differently. Large companies tend to have a very strict process they follow that most candidates have to go through while at smaller companies it can be common to make a hire mostly based on a referral or connection.

Your first task is to think about the type of role and type of company you want to work at. Spend some real time on this and write down your thoughts. Keep it close as it will impact all of the next steps.

Start Building Your Network

Now that you have a sense of what type of role you want and at what kind of company, you need to start networking.

Have you heard this Proverb?

""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.""

The same principle holds for networking.

The worst time to start networking is when you need it. At that point, it is likely too late, but if you find yourself in that situation, all you can do is start networking immediately. But realize that just like a newly planted tree, a newly developed network is fragile, and don’t expect it to bear much fruit. Instead, focus on growing and nourishing your network the best you can and look for it to bear fruit when it is more established.

But how exactly do you grow a network?

My best advice is to just start engaging with everyone you meet. And the best way to engage with people is to be truly interested in learning more about them. Next time you’re at the store, ask your cashier, ""What’s been the best part of your day?"" That’s a question that causes people to think and respond. And then maybe that response leads to a deeper conversation or maybe not. That’s okay. What you’re doing is learning how to engage with people and learning more about the people around you.

Extend this idea to LinkedIn. Next time you see an interesting conversation happening on a post, go engage with it!

Extend this idea to the next meet-up or conference you are at. Engage with the people around you and learn more about them.

What you will find is you start getting to know a ton of people! Many of these connections will end after the first conversation, but some of them will find deeper roots and remain and continue to grow into friendships. Continue to nourish them. Occasionally connect and see how they are doing, what new things they are up to, and if you can do anything to help.

The biggest advice I can give on networking is to focus on giving. Not only does it feel great to help others, but it also builds a strong foundation, so on the occasion when you need help, you’re network will be there for you. And it won’t feel awkward! You won’t be reaching out to strangers asking for a job, but friends who want to help.

Building this type of network takes time, so get started now! Find a way to engage with someone new today!

Better Understand Your Goal

Alright – now it is time to gather some data so that you can better understand the path before you.

Your first stop is the job boards. Do some research on the top 3 sites where companies post jobs for the type of role you identified in step 1. That could be as simple as big sites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor or maybe more niche sites such as the YC jobs board. I would also suggest looking at specific company career pages for your dream companies.

Study these job postings and start to tabulate data on what you find.

Do they mention Python, R, SQL, or Spark?

How about deep learning or reinforcement learning?

Maybe some engineering principles such as unit testing or continuous deployment come up.

Your goal is to start to understand what the core skills are for your dream role. Depending on how well you already understand the role you want, this process might just confirm what you already knew. But you might also discover common themes that surprise you.

Next – search for people on LinkedIn who already have the job that you want.

What skills do they seem to have? What are their backgrounds and experiences?

Add what you learn to the data you collected from the job postings. At this point, you should have a spreadsheet with a long list of skills and experiences and a count next to each with how often it came up in your research. Sort your table so that the most common skills are at the top. Having this sorted list of skills is crucial because data science is such a large field. It is basically impossible to be prepared for every possible interview subject. We will use your list in our next step to focus our efforts.

Solidify Your Foundation

Photo by Colton Sturgeon on Unsplash

Now – pick the top 5 skills you have on your list. These are the skills you need to have as solid as possible.

This is also where you need to be honest with yourself on where you are and what your timelines are. If you find you know very little about the top 5 skills needed and yet you need a job now, you should refocus your current efforts on a more attainable job right now and take the time you need to prepare for your dream role.

But at the same time, don’t be too pessimistic about where you are. If you are struggling to get a good gauge of your skills, see if you can reach out to your growing network to people in a role similar to the one you want to give you some feedback on your strengths and weaknesses.

Work down your top 5 and take the time you need to feel comfortable with those subjects.

Here are some resources for common data science subject areas:

Machine Learning: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

Linear Algebra: Gilbert Strang

Statistics: Doing Bayesian Data Analysis; Introduction to Statistical Learning, Think Stats

Analytics: Python for Data Analysis

Once you feel really solid with the top 5 skills, pick the next top 5 on your list and make sure you have at least a basic understanding of these areas.

At this point, you should feel like you have a pretty solid foundation of the core skills required for the job you want. This foundation will help you immensely as you start interviewing.

But, unfortunately, sometimes being a good data scientist doesn’t mean you will pass an interview. You need to prepare specifically for interview questions.

Use Google to help you prepare:

""How to Ace a Data Science Interview""

""Common Data Science Interview Questions""

These searches will give you a lot of resources for actual interview questions you can practice. Practice questions every day and try to focus on the questions you think are most relevant to the top skills you have identified.

Apply Everywhere

The recruiting process is pretty broken, so don’t trust it to always get it correct. You can’t control whether a company has a bad process, but you can control how many jobs you apply for. So make sure you apply for everything.

I think it is important to have the mindset that for the most part, it is not your job to filter yourself out before applying. Obviously, if you are not qualified at all for a position, you shouldn’t apply. But if you’re on the edge, go for it! Especially if you think you’re a great fit, but maybe have a few fewer years of experience than the job ""requires."" It isn’t uncommon for companies to learn during the process that some of their requirements were too strict and end up loosening them a bit depending on the applicants they receive.

If you are not getting interviews, here are some tips:

Reach out to your network for referrals.

Optimize your resume! Make sure you use a common resume format that makes it easy for recruiters to scan. Also, specifically, mention the skills asked for in the job posting to make sure bots don’t filter you out. And really highlight your work experiences that are most relevant to the job.

Have a friend or colleague review your resume and give you critical feedback.

This is the start of your job funnel, so make sure to spend time optimizing it. If you have to apply to hundreds of jobs to only get a few interviews, you will quickly run out of jobs to apply for or the energy to keep applying.

I’d recommend starting off by applying to maybe 20 jobs and then wait a bit to see what your response rate is. If you find it to be really low, make some tweaks to your resume, and try another 20. Keep iterating and hopefully improving your acceptance rate.

There you have it! My 5 step process will hopefully help you actually land a data science job. It is definitely a process and one that isn’t particularly easy. So – stick with it and try to continually improve on each step in the job funnel.

This role is similar to a typical data engineer but is usually embedded in a data science team rather than focusing on serving a broader set of stakeholders (such as engineers and product managers). Algorithms. This role creates business value by developing statistical, machine learning, and optimization models. Often, one performs exploratory data analysis to obtain a deeper understanding of the business problem and productionize models.

Even though each role may seem unique, there are often overlaps in responsibilities. In reality, it’s common to wear hats from multiple roles depending on the team composition and business needs (especially in smaller companies). Learning about the types of responsibilities and projects of the role is important for you to learn early in the process (by asking the recruiter or hiring manager) so that you can get a sense of your fit for the role.

The diagram below shows the distribution of different roles on the job market. This result is based on ~1,000 full-time data science job openings that were posted on LinkedIn September — November 2020.

It is clear that the dominating role is Analytics, while Statistics has the least positions. As such, if you’re early in your data science career, Analytics would be a great starting option.

That being said, which role most closely aligns with your skill set, interests, and role availability? Pick one and focus your attention on the skills you’ll need for that role, which we’ll share more about later in this post.

Next, let’s walk through the process you should expect during the interview process.

Interview Process: 5 Stages

In this section, we’ll discuss the typical stages of the interview process. Note that while most companies will have similar stages, the ordering may differ.

Below, we’ll dive deep into each of the stages, including the company’s goal, and what to expect. In the following section, we will go into more details about the types of questions asked for each type of interview.

1. Online Assessment

Typical length: 30min — 1hr • Types of interviews: Coding • Likelihood of occurrence: 1 of 3

Company goal: The online assessment is used by companies to screen out un-interested candidates and those without minimum technical skills.

The online assessment is usually completed on a coding website (eg., HackerRank) and does not involve a scheduled in-person interview, so it helps select candidates more efficiently.

2. Recruiter Phone Screen

Typical length: 30min • Types of interview: Behavior & Cross-function • Likelihood of occurrence: 3 of 3

Company goal: Recruiters typically ensure the role, your interests, timelines and requirements (eg., visa) fits well. This is an opportunity to highlight potential red flags for the candidate and the company.

The recruiter will start with introducing the company, role, and sometimes, the team you are interviewing for. Afterwards, the recruiter may ask you about your background, timeline, and what you’re looking for in a new role (including compensation). This is a great time to ask questions that may address any concerns.

3. Data Challenge

Typical length: 1 day — 2 weeks • Types of interview: Coding • Likelihood of occurrence: 2 of 3

Company goal: The data challenge screens out un-interested candidates and tests technical, problem solving, and communication skills.

The data challenge typically asks you to tackle a business case and provide recommendations based on sample data. Sometimes, you will be asked to write a summary document or presentation. Other times, you will be given a series of questions to answer. The method you use is often flexible because this round tests your problem solving skills rather than expertise in a particular language or tool. That said, the most common languages you might use are SQL, Python, and R. Some companies ask you to turn in your deliverable to determine whether you will move on while others may not require it. In both scenarios, it is common that you are asked to present your work during the next round.

4. Technical Phone Screen

Typical length: 30min — 1hr • Types of interview: Coding • Likelihood of occurrence: 2.5 of 3

Company goal: The technical phone screen is used to test demonstration of the minimum technical skills needed for the role.

You will usually interview with a Data Scientist or the hiring manager. At the beginning, they may ask you to introduce yourself or talk about your previous experiences.

Afterwards, the interviewer may dive into technical questions. The types of questions vary depending on the role and can include data extraction (SQL), metrics, statistics and probability, machine learning and coding questions. Typically, you will get a maximum of two types of questions. For example, if you’re applying for an Analytics role, you might get a combination of a data extraction and a metrics question. As this interview often varies widely, we recommend asking your recruiter what to expect before the interview.

5. Onsite (typically 4–6 rounds)

Typical length: 4–6 hrs • Types of interview: All • Likelihood of occurrence: 3 of 3

Company goal: The onsite consists of multiple interviews and will test most skills of the role required.

The onsite is the last and most changeling step before you land a job offer. An onsite is typically more comprehensive than prior interviews, as it contains multiple interviews (typically 4–6 interviews). Before COVID-19, most onsites were hosted at company campuses, however, now they are virtual. Depending on the type of role you are applying for, the combination of interview types may vary. For example, the onsite for an Analytics role may have multiple case interviews without any Machine Learning interviews. We will discuss this more in the next section.

While the process above describes the general steps, the types of interviews within this process can vary. Let’s dive deeper.

7 Types of Interviews

In this section, we’ll introduce 7 common types of interviews. We’ll also cover what companies are looking for and tips on how to perform well. Each interview typically assesses 1–2 skills and behavioral attributes. Sometimes, recruiters will explicitly tell you what to focus on so that you can prepare.

Interviews can be broken into technical and non-technical. Technical interviews are focused on “hard skills” required for the job, while non-technical interviews focus on “soft skills” (eg., communication, leadership) and team fit.

Below, we provide brief descriptions, example questions, and resources for each type of interview.

1. Coding Interview

This interview covers a variety of questions such as applied data extraction/manipulation problems, computer science fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, and programming best practices) and machine learning algorithms.

Depending on the type of the role, the questions can be different. SQL is required for almost all roles, so it is a very common language tested.

Example Questions

Get the average purchases for each user (SQL).

Find the median revenue grouped by country without using the median or percentile functions (SQL).

Find the median of an unsorted array (Python)

Code a classical machine learning algorithm, eg. k-means, k nearest neighbor (Python).

Top Tips

Before you begin coding, walk through your intended plan with the interviewer first, so that you can clarify questions and validate your approach.

You should know the basics, but you don’t have to memorize everything.

Resources

2. Data Challenge

This interview asks a candidate to analyze a sample data set (typically provided in a CSV file) and come up with recommendations to solve a business problem. Thus, this is typically either done in a take-home assessment or you may be asked to share your screen as you tackle the problem live. The problem can range from exploratory analysis, to data cleaning and extraction (SQL) problems, to feature engineering and modeling exercises (eg., prediction or segmentation).

Example Questions

Given a dataset of customer behaviors, define customer churn and find factors that may affect customer churn.

Given a dataset purchasing behavior, determine the trend of conversion rate and provide suggestions on improving it.

Top Tips

Have a clear understanding of the business problem before starting by researching the domain. Present solutions that focus on the problem at hand.

Don’t assume the data is clean unless stated. Consider checking corner cases and looking for outliers. If you don’t have time to check the data, clearly state your assumptions.

Summarize your work and provide next steps (eg., areas of further exploration).

3. Metric (“Case”) Interview

Given a business scenario, discuss your approach to a problem and make suggestions. These come in multiple flavors including: diagnosing metric shifts, how to measure success (eg., metric brainstorms), how to evaluate a feature with tradeoffs, and how to improve a product.

Example Questions

How would you investigate a negative metric shift in profit?

What are the pros and cons of using Daily Active Users (DAU) as a success metric?

How would you design an experiment for X feature?

If an A/B test shows that the desired metric (i.e, Click Through Rate) is going up while another metric (i.e., Clicks) is decreasing, how would you approach making a launch decision?

Top Tips

Regurgitate the context and goal of the exercise before answering and ask clarifying questions.

Ask the interviewer for a couple minutes for you to write answers down and structure your communication before speaking.

Consider briefly sharing multiple approaches first and asking your interviewer where to share more details, before giving your full answer.

This interview will test your understanding of applied statistics (eg., experimentation) and probability (e.g, Bayes theorem).

Example Questions

How would you describe a p-value / confidence interval to a 10 year old?

What is the probability of a person being infected of a disease given that the test is positive and the probability of having a disease is 0.1%?

What is the mean and variance of a binomial distribution?

How to simulate a biased coin using a fair coin?

Top Tips

You may not need to know the exact formula of calculating a specific metric. However, you should know what the variables are and the direction in which it moves the output metric (eg., confidence intervals increase with higher variance and lower sample sizes).

For probability questions, you can often answer the question by drawing out the permutations (eg., with a tree) and adding up the probabilities. It is okay if you don’t get the exact right answer (eg., due to a math error), especially if your approach is right.

5. Machine Learning Interview

This interview includes questions on machine learning fundamentals and solving problems using common techniques.

Example Questions

What is overfitting? How do you overcome overfitting?

How do you deal with an imbalanced data set?

Describe bias vs. variance.

Describe the Random Forest classifier.

When will you use L1 vs. L2 regularization?

Top Tips

Give a concise definition in 2 to 3 sentences. Provide one or two examples to convince the interviewer that you have both the theoretical knowledge and experience.

If necessary, provide some common solutions to the problem.

Resources

6. Experience Interview

In this interview, you will discuss your previous professional experience with the hiring manager or prospective colleagues. The questions are mostly non-technical, behavioral questions. Because this interview is usually performed by somebody on the team you’re interviewing for, the questions may target common pain points or situations of the team.

Example Questions

Tell me a time when you had a large impact. What was the context, how did you approach it, and how did you overcome challenges?

Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict or had to convince a stakeholder on an opposing viewpoint.

Top Tips

Pause often and ask the interviewer if they have any questions or if they would like you to share more details on a specific topic.

In preparation for the interview, determine 3–5 projects that can be used as examples for most behavioral interviews. Write down the context, challenges, your solutions, and impact so you don’t have to improvise during the interview.

Resources

7. Cross-functional / Company values Interview

In this interview, you will be asked to give examples of how you collaborated in prior experiences and what you would do in hypothetical scenarios. The interview typically aims at identifying candidates who have a good fit of the company’s culture.

Example Questions

Tell me about a time your recommendation was at odds with somebody else. How did you achieve a solution?

Tell me about a time you had to prioritize multiple high urgency projects. How did you overcome it?

Top Tips

Review the “company values” (usually on the company website). Prepare situations in which you exemplified those values.

If possible, research who your interviewers are beforehand. Visualize their challenges (eg., product managers may want to know how you provide data to stakeholders) and brainstorm past experiences that might relate well to those situations.

Prioritizing Focus Areas of Preparation

These seven types of interviews can be overwhelming! In this section, we dive into how to prioritize them to stay organized and efficient in your preparation.

Here are some general tips:

Learn more about getting organized in your preparation process (video).

Before the process, ask the recruiter about the types of interviews to expect (video).

Once you know the process, prioritize preparation in the order of the interviews (eg., if the experience interview is first, prep for that). If you’re just getting started, prioritize the coding interviews first.

Finally, depending on the type of role you are interviewing for, you should focus on preparing for certain interviews more than others. The chart below can give you insight into which areas to focus on.

Source: Image by the author.

You may notice that coding and non-technical interviews are required across the board, and some Data Scientist types do not need to prepare fully for every type of interview. For example, Analytics should focus less on Machine learning and more on Metric (“Case”) interviews.

This can give you a sense of where to prioritize depending on your strengths/weaknesses and the type of role you are applying for.

Keep In Mind: Attributes Assessed

While preparing for the hard skills is helpful, it is often not enough. You will be assessed on additional attributes throughout the entire process. Although every company has different frameworks of assessing these skills, they typically look for the same qualities. In general, companies are looking for candidates to demonstrate ability in the following areas throughout the process:

Communication — ability to deliver effective verbal and written communication to technical and non-technical audiences. This can be demonstrated by answering questions in a coherent and logical way and explaining technical concepts using examples and analogies.

Collaboration & Influence — ability to explore different viewpoints and reach consensus with partners. This can be demonstrated by your ability to take feedback during the interview and incorporating multiple viewpoints into your answers.

These attributes are difficult to prepare for, but you can demonstrate them with more practice. Here are three tips:

Speak with the context and audience in mind: Different audiences care about different aspects. For example, managers are more interested in high-level ideas and business impacts, while individual contributors may care more about technical details. Most audiences will require sufficient elaboration on the background and context.

Data science has become one of the most in-demand fields in recent years. As companies increasingly collect and generate data, they need individuals who can sift through this information to identify trends and make predictions.

While a data scientist’s job may vary depending on the industry, their responsibilities usually fall into one of three categories: Type A, Type B, and Type C. In this article, we’ll explore the three main areas that data scientists should focus on. In addition, we’ll describe a possible strategy to start a career in Data Science and some tips to learn new skills.

The article is organized as follows:

Type A — the Analyst

Type B — the Builder

Type C — the Consultant

Starting a career in Data Science

Learning new skills

Type A — the Analyst

Type A stands for Analyst. As the name suggests, these individuals excel at analyzing data. They’re great at taking large amounts of data and making sense of it all.

Analysts are often thought of as “traditional” data scientists. They are highly skilled in statistics and modeling, and they use these skills to extract insights from data. Analysts are often very good at communicating their findings to non-technical audiences since they understand both the technical details and the business implications of their work.

Skills

Initially, data analysts come from a very heavy research background. Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare. For this reason, currently, their actual study background doesn’t matter so much, it is more about their work experience. However, you can still have people with technical degrees, such as computer science degrees and statistics that would work as data analysts, although in most cases, these people fall in the Type B category.

A data analyst performs data analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization, make some dashboards, and try and figure out what’s going on with the data. That’s a very large component of data science.

Another important skill for analysts is programming. Programming languages like R and Python are designed specifically for working with data. If you want to be able to manipulate data effectively, you need to know how to program.

Third, you need to have an open mind. Data science can be challenging, and it is important to be willing to learn new things. If you are closed-minded, you will likely find yourself struggling with data science.

Last but not least, a good data analyst should be curious. Once you have collected data, you should be curious about the data and start asking questions. Questions can lead to more questions, and this is how hypotheses are formed. For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision that you want to learn more things. It’s as simple as that. Everyone can do their own version of curiosity.

Type B — the Builder

Type B stands for Builder. Builders are essentially software engineers, focused on the realm of data science applications. You do stuff in the cloud, set up the infrastructure, manage workflows, work with the data engineering team to make sure all the pipelines are solid, and force other members of your team to write clean code, unit tests, functional tests, and different things to make sure that the code will run in production.

You can also think of them as the “new age machine learning engineers”. They build those systems and the Machine Learning ops, automated machine learning programs, and different things like that.

One of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type is that the Building type always wants to work in the production environment. There’s almost a different mindset.

Skills

As a Type B scientist, you should know frameworks like Git, Docker, and cloud computing platforms. These are important tools for managing and analyzing data.

Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to your code. Docker is a tool that helps you package up your code so it can run in different environments. Cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable resources for storing and processing data.

Differences between Type A and Type B

Type A and Type B have a quite different mindset. Type A is more exploratory, and Type B focuses more on production.

The type A data scientist will be very happy to play around in Jupyter Notebooks: take data from a CSV file, explore and see what’s there, and try to apply some machine learning to it straight away — after figuring out what the problem is, of course. But the Type B data scientist doesn’t want to do that. They think of all of that stuff as a waste of time. They’re going to refactor it, to change it somehow.

The following figure shows the technical skills required for Types A and B:

Type C — the Consultant

Type C stands for “Consultant”. In the past, a data scientist was the intersection of the programmer, mathematician, and business domain expert. This type C is essentially that person in the middle, but with very strong consulting skills.

As the name suggests, consultants are all about giving advice. But unlike other types of data scientists, who tend to focus on either the technical aspects of data analysis or the business applications, consultants have really strong stakeholder engagement and communication to make sure that the business problems will be solved adequately with the right solutions.

Consultants are also experienced in working with a variety of different businesses, so they can quickly adapt to your company’s needs.

Skills

Usually, type C scientists are either people leaders or project managers. Or they’re very good at persuading and talking to business. If you’re a strong talker, you’re more likely to be a people leader. Usually, the type C data scientist will be your manager of data science, your head of data science, or your chief data scientist.

There are different types of consultants as well. You can think of them as true consultants. They aren’t working very deep into the data. They’re talking about the process to solve problems, work closely with the stakeholders to figure out what the problems are and make sure that their concerns and issues are all addressed. But often we see that some leaders are not very technical.

The most important thing for the Type C data scientist will be a commercial mindset: commercial acumen of being able to make decisions, people leadership, being able to talk to businesses, convince leaders to do something, as well as a storytelling piece.

Starting a career in Data Science

Here are a few things to keep in mind if you’re wondering if a career in data science is right for you:

Data science is a team sport — No matter how talented you are, you won’t be able to do everything on your own. Data science is a collaborative field, so you’ll need to be able to work well with others. This means being able to communicate effectively and being open to different perspectives.

The field is constantly changing — If you’re the type of person who likes stability and hates change, data science may not be the right fit for you. The field is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to be comfortable with change. This means being open to new ideas and technologies and

In data science, it is often said that domain expertise is key. This is true to some extent — if you want to be a data scientist working on medical data, it helps to have a background in medicine. However, domain expertise is not always necessary to get started in data science.

Where to start

As a fresher, breaking into the data science field can seem daunting. However, with the right attitude and some hard work, it is definitely possible to make a name for yourself in this exciting and ever-growing industry. Here are a few tips on how to get started:

1. Learn Python or R. These are the two most popular programming languages for data science and are relatively easy to learn compared to other languages.

2. Get familiar with basic statistical concepts. Understanding means, median, mode, variance, etc. will be helpful in your journey to becoming a data scientist.

3. Start playing around with data! Use public datasets to practice your new skills or try out different data analysis techniques. Kaggle is a great resource for finding datasets and participating in competitions.

4. Learn Machine Learning. This is a huge field of study within data science and can seem daunting at first, but there are plenty of resources available to help you get started (including our own course!).

5. Networking is another key component of breaking into data science. Attend meetups and conferences, and connect with people already working in the field — they may be able to offer advice or even help you land your first job.

6. Stay up to date with the latest news and advancements in data science. Read blogs, listen to podcasts, watch talks online… there are lots of ways to stay informed about what’s going on in the world of data science.

Learning new skills

There are many skills that are needed in order to work as a data scientist. However, there are also many skills that can be learned in order to become a data scientist. Many people who are interested in data science may not have the opportunity to learn these skills at their job. However, there are many ways to learn the skills outside of work.

One way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through online courses. There are many online courses that teach the basics of data science. These courses can be found on websites such as Coursera and Udacity. In addition, there are many blog posts and articles that can be found online that can help someone learn the basics of data science.

Another way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through conferences and meetups. There are many conferences and meetups that discuss data science topics. These events can be found in cities all over the world. Attendees of these events can learn from presentations and network with other people who are interested in data science.

Finally, another way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through books. There are many books that have been written about data science.

AI in the Workplace – As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into business operations, preparing employees for an AI-enhanced workplace is imperative. AI is not just a future consideration; it’s a present reality that is transforming the landscape of work across industries. To stay competitive and efficient, businesses must equip their workforce with the skills and understanding necessary to work alongside AI. In doing so, companies can harness the full potential of AI-enhancing productivity and driving innovation while ensuring their teams can adapt and thrive in this new environment.

Implementing an effective AI training programme is essential in building a workforce ready for technological change. Key factors to consider include fostering a culture that embraces continual learning and evolution, developing leadership skills fit for decision-making in an AI era, and prioritising ethical considerations and trust in AI systems. Moreover, reinventing talent acquisition, evaluating business outcomes of AI integration, and shaping communication and collaboration strategies are all critical elements to successfully transitioning to an AI-enhanced workplace. As we move forward, embracing change and preparing for a dynamic future work environment becomes a collective journey for us all.

The Fundamentals of AI in the Workplace

The ubiquity of AI in the workplace is reshaping how we approach jobs, labour, and technology adoption. In this guide, we’re exploring the foundational elements of AI that businesses must understand to thrive in an AI-enhanced environment.

Understanding AI and Its Implications

AI, or artificial intelligence, has pervaded numerous aspects of business operations, from decision-making processes to customer interactions. Generative AI platforms, with their ability to produce content and provide insights, are one striking example of this integration. The implications for labour productivity and efficiency are substantial, with AI’s capability to automate routine tasks and analyse large datasets.

The Intersection of AI and Human Labour

As AI becomes more sophisticated, its interplay with human labour is increasingly complex. While automation may displace certain job roles, it concurrently creates new jobs in fields such as AI management and development. Navigating this transition requires a strategic approach, ensuring that workforce skills evolve in line with technological advancements.

Changing Nature of Work and Job Roles

The very nature of work sees a transformation with the AI evolution. Jobs once characterised by rote tasks are now looking towards roles where human creativity and strategic thinking are paramount. The redefinition of job roles necessitates an emphasis on upskilling and a thorough understanding of how to leverage AI technology effectively. This not only improves workflows but also enriches the quality of work, leading to more fulfilling career paths.

Should you want a more detailed insight into how this affects your business, Ciaran Connolly, ProfileTree Founder, notes, “Embracing AI, while nurturing the unique qualities of human labour, is key to sustaining innovation and staying ahead in the modern marketplace.”

Building a Culture Ready for Technological Change

In the face of rapid technological change, it’s paramount that companies foster an environment that embraces these developments. The bedrock of such a culture lies in nurturing continuous learning and stimulating adaptability and innovation.

Creating a Culture of Continuous Learning

We, at ProfileTree, understand that continuous learning is the engine that powers a future-ready workforce. As digital marketing experts, we’ve seen the astonishing pace at which AI has revolutionised industries. It demands that employees not only keep their skills sharp but also acquire new knowledge proactively. Encouraging a learning mindset entails:

Structured Learning Paths : Craft programmes that cater to different learning stages, ensuring beginners can grasp the basics while advanced learners can delve into in-depth topics.

: Craft programmes that cater to different learning stages, ensuring beginners can grasp the basics while advanced learners can delve into in-depth topics. Leverage Technology for Training: Utilise AI tools and platforms that offer tailored learning experiences, optimising the upskilling process.

Promoting Adaptability and Innovation

Adaptability and innovation are not just buzzwords but essential traits in today’s digital landscape. To instil these qualities, we:

Cultivate a Safe Space for Experimentation : Establish an environment where trial and error is not merely accepted but encouraged. Contemplate initiatives like “Innovation Fridays” , where employees are given time to explore new ideas.

: Establish an environment where trial and error is not merely accepted but encouraged. Contemplate initiatives like , where employees are given time to explore new ideas. Recognise and Reward: Honour those who take bold steps in innovation to show that their efforts are valued.

“Incorporating AI into our operations isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about unlocking human potential to innovate,” says Ciaran Connolly, ProfileTree Founder. “We approach technological change as an opportunity for growth, for both our clients and our team.”

Designing Effective AI Training Programmes

To prepare for an AI-enhanced workplace, it’s essential that we create AI training programmes that are both comprehensive and tailored to the individual needs of our employees. These programmes must not only cover the necessary technical skills but also foster AI literacy and the adaptability required in a rapidly changing environment.

Identification of Necessary Skills

The first step in designing an effective AI training programme is determining the essential skills that employees must possess. We recommend conducting a skills gap analysis to pinpoint the exact areas where training is most needed. For instance, employees may require an in-depth understanding of data analysis, machine learning, or natural language processing, depending on their roles. By aligning the AI competencies with the goals of your organisation, the training can better equip staff to utilise AI tools efficiently.

Bespoke Learning Pathways

Personalised training pathways are crucial for maximising learning outcomes. Each employee’s background, experience, and role should inform the creation of a tailored training journey. For example, a marketer might need to focus on AI tools for customer segmentation, while a customer service representative might benefit from training on chatbots and AI-driven support tools. It’s vital to use adaptive learning platforms that calibrate content difficulty and topics based on the learner’s progress and performance.

BrainStation, which offered its first bootcamp in 2012, operates in five locations: Toronto and Vancouver in Canada, New York and Miami in the United States, and London in the United Kingdom. COVID-19 restrictions mean that some courses may be held online. With a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:8, students have ample access to faculty as well as to a wide variety of additional training resources and materials online.

The program is divided into five units: fundamentals of data analysis and visualization, analysis for data science, machine learning techniques, big data fundamentals with machine learning, and professional development.

Instruction primarily focuses on SQL and Python and on several packages and libraries created for statistical analysis and data science such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit Learn. The program emphasizes modeling and ML techniques using Python, but students are also exposed to tools such as R and Tableau, along with big data tools such as TensorFlow, Hadoop, and Spark.

Students work on a real-world business case prior to graduation to gain practical, hands-on data science experience. Working alongside industry practitioners, students collaborate with teams from other BrainStation bootcamps. Students’ projects are showcased at a graduation Demo Day, attended by hundreds of hiring managers, data professionals, and BrainStation alumni.

While a bachelor’s degree in science, technology, engineering, or math is considered “beneficial,” it isn’t required. Full-time students are in class 35 to 40 hours per week throughout the 12-week program, but additional time is required outside of class to complete projects. Part-time students attend classes on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and all day on Saturdays.

The bootcamp offers a range of career services, including portfolio development, mock interviews with current industry professionals, resume and job search workshops, and office tours of leading tech companies.

Cost: A one-time payment of $15,000 or 24 monthly payments starting at $664. Scholarships are available.

This bootcamp requires a foundation in basic Python skills, so it starts off with a free beginner course, Intro to Python. While this bootcamp was previously an in-person program in New York, Byte Academy has moved exclusively to online instruction in response to the pandemic. There are, however, regularly scheduled networking opportunities in New York that are open to current students, alumni, and both current and past staff members.

The 24-week program begins with 10 weeks of intensive instruction, with a teacher-to-student ratio “as low as” 1:5, followed by a 10-week, hands-on experiential project and a four-week mandatory internship with a potential employer.

The bootcamp promises to teach students how to extract meaningful patterns from data, as well as help them learn the applied coding skills needed to turn theory into practice. Students apply their knowledge during a succession of projects and project reviews, as well as through the practice of foundational interview concepts designed to build up the quality of students’ code and prepare them for employment.

During the intensive instruction period, students learn the basics of data science, object-oriented programming, data structures, and software theory, as well as machine learning theory, supervised and unsupervised learning, and neural networks. Python is the core coding language; the program also covers libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Coursework also touches on Jupyter notebooks, some web scraping, SQL, Git protocol, Bash, Linux, and system architecture.

Costs: Byte Academy's tuition is $25,000, with financing options available. But its website highlights a “no tuition until you’ve made it” agreement, which it describes as “enroll now and pay when hired.” Under this option, program graduates earning at least $40,000 annually pay 15% of their salary for three years, up to a maximum of $30,000.

This 16-week online bootcamp offers an optional three-month internship that includes extensive career support afterward. Focusing on data science, engineering, and machine learning, the program—first offered in 2014—is conducted online live for three hours weekly and assigns two to three hours of homework per week. Live sessions are recorded for later review. The teacher-to-student ratio is 1:15, and instructors are available immediately before and after class as well as during weekday office hours.

No prior knowledge of data science or programming is required. During the bootcamp, all students work collaboratively, but submissions are graded individually. In addition to in-class model-building and coding exercises, attendees also spend an average of 15 hours over the course of the program working on a data science competition.

Cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks allow working from anywhere via a browser-based tool rather than having to purchase or work in a dedicated programming environment. Instructors teach using R but also offer the corresponding Python code.

Tools used include Azure, AWS, Hadoop, Spark, and Kaggle. Topics covered include building predictive models, cross-validation techniques, evaluation metrics, A/B testing, linear models, and the end-to-end process of handling data from extraction to real-time analysis.

After the bootcamp, students have access to an extensive repository of tutorials, demos, and exercises to continue developing new skills. Graduates can receive a data science certificate from the University of New Mexico.

Costs: Bootcamp without internship and career support: $2,999; bootcamp with three-month practicum internship, mentoring, development of a data science portfolio, and career support: $9,999. Financing options are available, including payment plans, interest-free loans, and deferred payments until graduation.

This 20-week online bootcamp is centered on five intensive projects that require a weekly time commitment of 15 to 20 hours; before the program begins, students complete 60 hours of online pre-work. Students are expected to have experience in both programming and math. While a deeper background in either area is helpful, it isn’t considered critical to success.

Metis offers a free admission prep class to build skills in linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and Python fundamentals.

The bootcamp focuses on five modules: exploratory data analysis, linear regression and web scraping, business fundamentals for data practitioners, machine learning classification, and natural language processing and unsupervised learning.

Following each module, students demonstrate mastery of the subjects by completing a business-oriented project designed to help them develop a portfolio of work to share with prospective employers. Languages, systems, and tools covered include Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Git and GitHub, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Sci-Kit Learn, Keras, Spark, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, SQLite, MongoDB, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, HTML, CSS, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Flask, and Heroku.

For each project, students learn to identify business problems as well as extract, clean, analyze, and interpret data before communicating the results in a presentation. The program focuses on the full lifecycle of being a data professional, in addition to teaching theory and technologies.

Metis combines asynchronous learning with weekly live online interaction. Students watch on-demand lectures, complete online exercises and assessments, and engage with instructors, teaching assistants, and classmates via Slack and during Zoom office hours—including weekly half-hour, one-on-one sessions with an instructor.

After graduation, students have access to all course materials for six months and career support until hired.

Cost: $11,000; $3,000 scholarships are available for women, the LGBTQ community, members of underrepresented groups, and U.S. military veterans. Installment plans are available, including zero-interest payment plans for qualified applicants. Loans are also available.

This 400-hour bootcamp teaches data science with machine learning; it can be completed over the course of 12 weeks as a full-time, hybrid in-person/remote program at the academy’s New York facility. Students may also choose to participate through distance learning—16 weeks for a full 40 hours per week or 24 weeks for a 20-to-30-hour part-time program.

Applicants for the highly competitive program, which began in 2015, must hold at least a bachelor’s degree, with a strong preference for prospective students with degrees in STEM disciplines and those who already hold a master’s degree or doctorate. Applicants with strong domain knowledge in an area that employs data scientists and who have some background in either coding or statistics also will be considered.

In rare circumstances, applicants without a degree may be considered, but they must be high school graduates who can prove exceptional talent in computer programming, have proof of domain knowledge in math and science, have two letters of recommendation from relevant professionals, and be able to pass the academy’s technical assessment with a grade of B or better.

Students take seven modules to learn the major tools and methods for performing data analyses and apply them to various projects typically found in the data science field. Students complete four projects using real-world datasets before completing a capstone project that's usually sponsored by a New York-based company.

Students not only learn the knowledge and skills for data analytics but also study supervised and unsupervised models of machine learning and other more advanced topics.

Before the bootcamp begins, students must complete 40 hours of online coursework and more than 200 exercises to prepare to work with both R and Python as well as revisit basic concepts in linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.

At the foundation level of the program, students learn to employ R and Python for data analytics projects and for presenting research results effectively. Beyond the foundational level, students study machine learning with Python and carry out research projects that involve advanced data science methods and strategies.

The program also exposes students to concepts and practices in deep learning and big data. In addition to R and Python, students learn about Linux, GitHub, SQL, Hadoop, and Spark, among myriad other tools.

Cost: $17,600. Payment plans and scholarships are available.

This unique program—Europe’s largest data science training bootcamp—requires applicants to hold either a master’s or doctorate degree in an analytical field. Offered since 2014, the five full-time weeks of intensive, project-based training are intended to help professionals and academics who already have the foundational skills of a data scientist transition into new careers in the field.

Unlike most data science programs, where the focus is on theoretical learning, S2DS recognizes each student’s prior education and experience and emphasizes training that develops analytical knowledge to tackle a real data science problem with a commercial partner. After a handful of introductory best-practices lectures, the program concentrates on training students to communicate results to non-experts and aligning data analysis with key business drivers.

The online program operates from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., U.K. time, Mondays through Fridays, and includes optional evening networking events. Students work in five-member teams throughout the bootcamp. Each team works with a program mentor, a technical mentor, and a business mentor. Teams meet with program mentors weekly and with technical mentors daily. Business mentors interact with the team weekly for a minimum of half a day.

The program does not teach coding and does not have a set curriculum. Applicants must have an intermediate level—at least 100 hours—of coding experience in Python or R. Specific tools and technical skills for each project are customized through on-the-job development.

Cost: £800 ($1,043 at the time of writing). Partial scholarships are available.

A lot of people believe that you cannot have a data scientist job without having a traditional degree, but the truth is that a data science boot camp can be extremely helpful. In their current form, boot camps that teach data science are rapidly on the rise because they deliver precisely the type of intensive and industry-specific education that candidates require in order to stake their claim to the best jobs in the field. Being part of a boot camp means that there is an expert to review your progress, resume, and portfolio, and guide you through the process of finding the right job. This article will try to answer the question- “are data science boot camps worth it?”

What is a Data Science Boot Camp?

Data science boot camps are intensive, relatively brief training grounds that can take graduates with no experience to entry-level jobs in just three to six months of instruction. Graduates are equipped with technical skills in data visualization, data analysis, predictive analytics, statistical analysis, and programming.

Predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics, and machine learning are used by data science to assist in making predictions and more so, decisions. To put it even more simply, it applies math and technology to search for less obvious relationships and means to increase efficiency and revenue in the numbers.

The role of a Data Scientist involves analyzing data, including gathering, organizing, training, and exploring the data from different perspectives. So, are data science boot camps worth it, and if so how do they help?

Data science boot camps enable students to get familiar with a number of languages and frameworks to achieve that such as Python, Pandas, Hadoop, R, SQL, and Spark. Compared to conventional academic programs, data science boot camps are shorter in duration, and they also tend to provide more practical experience than most post-secondary programs.

Types of Data Science Boot Camps

If you are wondering are data science boot camps worth it? Understanding their different types might be helpful.

Full-time, in-person boot camps

When people hear the keywords ‘boot camp,’ the image that may be associated with it is most likely this one. This would most likely be a concentrated program where you would be attending class, anywhere from forty to eighty hours a week while you also dedicate certain hours of your own time to the projects.

What are the advantages of such a model? It is the fastest method that can be used to achieve one’s goals. The downside? Balancing a job is likely to be difficult or in some cases even unfeasible.

Full-time, online boot camps

Almost all the full-time online data science boot camps will still expect you to attend classes four times a week, for about four hours a day, but the rest of the classes like quizzes and assignments will be done in the evenings on the weekends.

Part-time, in-person boot camps

This is a nice middle ground for those who are not yet ready to commit to a full-time schedule. You get some of the perks of being in an in-person course – which may include better networking opportunities, chances to attend events on the campus, and, the best equipment one can use after the classes are over.

Of course, there is a downside – it may take you longer to get up and running as a Data Scientist. The vast majority of the part-time courses usually require two to three times as many credit hours in order to complete than the full-time courses.

Part-time, online boot camps

And if you desire the most possible flexibility, you can do a flexible online course. This option might be most suitable for those persons who are already in workplaces and they just need some additional skills. However, unlike the face-to-face programs, it will take more time to complete the course when it is an online self-paced program.

What Does a Data Science Boot Camp Teach You?

To understand- are data science boot camps worth it, we first need to know what is taught in one. Data science boot camps are different from the conventional college setup in that they focus little on theory as compared to a traditional college education.

Boot camps, on the other hand, are more centered around providing practical useful skills and exposing the graduates to technologies that will be used daily.

Depending on which data science boot camp you opt for, the topics that are imparted and the manner in which it is done may vary slightly. Nearly every data science boot camp student will definitely delve into some concepts taught which are listed below.

1. Coding Languages– While it is possible that some specific boot camps for data science mention knowledge of other languages like Java or C++, the majority of programs cover Python. It is an open-source programming language suitable for many tasks, such as building websites and developing machine-learning models.

Python is also useful for data scientists to sort and filter large datasets, which is essential in big data analysis. Depending on your instructor, you might also get to learn more tools in Python programming like Python libraries.

2. Machine Learning– Another popular subject that many boot camps concentrate on is machine learning. Machine learning will allow you to teach computers how to perform certain tasks on their own without being specifically coded or programmed. Data science learners generally understand techniques such as regression and logistic regressions, in order to accomplish machine learning.

3. Data Science Fundamentals– Many people who enroll in data science boot camps are keen on applying themselves to coding, machine learning, or what is referred to as ‘big data’. However, it is very critical to have these fundamentals if one is to train themselves for the long haul.

In the initial part of a boot camp, the instructors familiarise the students with how to use probability theory and conduct A/B tests. These basic skills are also useful in handling the larger basic competencies during the later segments of the program.

4. Soft Skills– While boot camps are mainly concerned with creating technical expertise, they might impart some of the soft skills. For example, data scientists ought to create value from a problem by employing information. Data science boot camp participants work on assignments that aid in the enhancement of their problem-solving abilities and enable them to come up with individual solutions for problems. These include- Written communication, Verbal communication, Networking skills, and Teamwork.

What Are the Benefits of Data Science Boot Camps?

Let’s explore some benefits of boot camps to understand- are data science boot camps worth it.

A Data Scientist invests a considerable amount of time in acquiring, selecting, purging, structuring, and analyzing data then further leveraging various methodologies such as Predictive Causal Analytics i.e scenario of preceding event analysis or de novo computation of an event; Prescriptive Analytics meaning the idea generation and scenarios along with translated strategies and outcomes; and Machine learning.

For this purpose, the data science boot camps equip the students with the necessary tools to learn an abundance of languages and frameworks like Python, Pandas, Java, Scala, Hadoop, R, SQL, Julia, MATLAB, Spark, etc.

Some of those newer languages are not very popular and it will surely provide a candidate an upper hand in the market. In contrast to conventional colleges, boot camps may be flexible when it comes to reacting to a rapidly evolving sector.

It has also become expected that networking is a major focus while attending a boot camp. Schools even organize their own networking sessions, and guest speakers from leading software companies visit them while most of the teaching faculty are well-connected computer industry professionals.

Not only that, students around you will be other aspiring tech professionals, and they will contribute towards building your initial network in the data segment.

Thus, these programs offer many advantages, such as professional contacts, current curricula, and, last but not least, the opportunity to find well-paid Data Scientist positions after studying for only three to six months. In the next section, we explain these in detail.

Advantages of a Data Science Boot Camp

Are data science boot camps worth it? To answer this question we first need to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the same. Admittedly there are a host of possible advantages in attending a boot camp. Here are the pros of data science boot camps-

1. It prepares you for a new career quickly. The biggest selling point might just be that you will be ready for the job market and ready to find a job quicker than you can imagine, especially if one were to compare this situation to a college degree let alone more so if you added any post-graduate work at the end of it all.

In a period of three to six months, one can be prepared for an interview for an entry-level job. What makes that such a compelling proposition is when you consider that stats from PayScale have revealed the possibility of earning around $85,000 per annum for an entry-level Data Scientist.

2. Build your professional network. Another promising feature is that it can generate potentially numerous opportunities for networking. Many schools organize networking events and invite guest speakers from famous IT companies to speak at the school, graduate project presentations, and experienced specialists who have many contacts. The other students will also be good contacts as they too will be seeking employment in the near future.

3. Acquire employment skills that are highly sought after. This is because Data Scientist is considered to be the most promising career by LinkedIn, and the best job in many countries by Glassdoor. Currently, demand is high and continues to grow as does remuneration and the opportunity for career advancement.

A study conducted by MIT proved that if companies in a specific industry leverage themselves into the top third in data utilization, they can be five percent more productive and can bring in six percent more profits than their rivals. Bear in mind that data science is still an emerging discipline and many organizations have not fully grasped the possibilities and the profits they could gain with an investment in data.

Disadvantages of a Data Science Boot Camp

We have seen the advantages that help answer the question of whether data science boot camps are worth it. But there are some disadvantages that also need to be taken into account to get a full picture. One of the shortcomings is the relatively low emphasis placed on statistics as compared to more conventional college curricula.

Depending on the type of job you’re looking for data science is a massive field and whether it would be best to go to a boot Camp, get a master’s degree, or whether other online learning resources would be better suited for you.

When it comes to machine learning, data science boot camps can be ideal as the educational facilities that equip you with all the programming languages required for model building and implementation. There are, however, some cases where it is better not to engage in a boot camp at all.

For work in research, graduates often require additional credits of study and possibly a master’s degree. The same might be true if you are planning to get a job for a financial firm or any company that deals with financial matters.

Of course, no program is perfect, and to know are data science boot camps worth it, you should check before you sign up by reading the students’ testimonials and some other reviewing platforms.

Avoid programs where costs do not reflect curriculum or job placement outcomes or boot camps that are scanty on details on delivery format, instructors, or services offered after graduation. Some other disadvantages include-

1. Availability– especially if you are a parent or guardian in a job, a small-scale business person, or somebody with a lot of working hours.

2. Expenditure– that has to be paid at the start of the project, especially where no other method of reimbursement is possible

3. Insufficient physical interaction– especially in instances where the boot camps are entirely or mostly virtual.

4. There is no uniformity to technology- each privately owned boot camp is developed with what the parent organization believes is most important for the field of data science, and this may or may not serve the purposes of certain positions or the businesses of one’s choice.

You can now weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself- are data science boot camps worth it?

Can a Data Science Boot Camp Get You a Job?

Yes, it is very much possible for you to get a job as the survey shows that a very high percentage of the students graduating from data science boot camps have secured jobs in that field.

For example, a source indicated that data science bootcamp students secured employment with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook among others, with over 95% of bootcamp learners securing employment within 180 days.

If you’re wondering are data science boot camps worth it, job titles like Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Big Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Database Administrator are all possible career paths after completing such programs.

Data science boot camps are well appreciated among employers because they expect the graduates to be dedicated, hardworking, and skilled in the most recent systems, techniques, and platforms.

You are also demonstrating to them that you are a dedicated student, which is a highly desirable trait in an industry that is constantly evolving.

However, not all the programs are equally popular among employers, and your job will depend on how the school is ranked, and what kind of projects a candidate can present to the employer.

Many boot camp graduates can attest to the fact that employers are always willing to connect regardless of the fact that you graduated from a data science boot camp alone.

This is why such a colossal percentage of the boot camp grads are able to find jobs in three to six months; when it comes to skills in data sciences, it is the demand that drives the supply, and companies are vying with each other to get the best Data Scientists.

This is often because those who have graduated from the data science boot camps are likely to finish projects during their completion program that they could showcase to employers as evidence of their skills. In addition, most establishments are affiliated with major technology firms, which fund awards and activities.

How to Make Data Science Boot Camps Worth It?

Several aspects apply to the success that you derive from data science boot camps. It depends on the effort that you are willing to exercise, the method that you intend to use as well as your commitment level. Here are some of the strategies necessary for a data science camp to be worthwhile.

1. It is important that you research well and make the right decision when considering are data science boot camps are worth it. That employers are interested in boot camp graduates is indisputable, but not all schools can boast a good reputation.

Before you embark on boot camp, you need to ensure that the boot camp that you are enrolling in is recognized. One can go to the internet and read students’ feedback, examine current students or alumni in data science, or ask a recruiter or a hiring manager in data science about their stand on the best programs and the school.

Consider the list of courses offered by the boot camp and the requirements for joining the program. If it’s an in-person course, explore the campus, or if it is an online course, virtually tour a campus. And if possible, review the boot camp’s outcomes report to know the performance of their graduates.

2. Get yourself out there and network. Another aspect that boot camp alumni express great appreciation for is the networking that takes place through on-campus (and online) events, and even guest speakers with leading tech companies who come to the classrooms of the top data science boot camps.

Sometimes your classmates could be your working partners or colleagues in the future, so it is good to build those relations too. The same applies to your instructors and other academic personnel as well. A good number of boot camps are run by professionals with deep network connections in the industry. This is a good chance to make a good impression with them.

3. Begin with live projects as soon as possible. Another factor as to why such a high number of data science boot camp alumni find employment shortly after completing their programs is that most of them can be working on actual projects while undergoing their respective programs to demonstrate to potential employers that they are capable of performing such duties.

4. Seek feedback. You should select a worthwhile data science boot camp that will have instructors with a lot of working experience in what you want to do as a career.

Seriously consider the impressions they have about your projects and visualizations; a prospective employer is bound to have the same impression. Being able to talk to an industry expert is another perk of going to a boot camp, so make sure to seize this opportunity.

Following these strategies, you will be able to answer are data science boot camps worth it with a positive affirmation.

The entire bootcamp concept is to give you the knowledge you require to start a new career. A bootcamp certificate on your resume shows that you’ve put in the work to acquire the skills you need to be employable. True, your certificate isn’t a golden ticket that’s going to get you a six-figure job right out of school, but your bootcamp will very likely include some type of career services that will help you find employment. Your boot camp is obviously going to want you to secure a data science role. That is, after all, its raison d’être.

What Job Prospects and Career Paths Are Available for Data Science Bootcamp Graduates?

As a data science bootcamp graduate, you’ll be able to enter the thriving (and sexy, according to the Harvard Business Review) world of data science. The field is a broad one, and the people who make up job titles have had a field day creating names for data science roles. Thus, you’ll encounter not only Data Scientist and Data Analyst, but also titles like Decision Scientist, Big Data Analytics Consultant, Business Intelligence Analyst, Financial Analyst, Statistician, Database Administrator, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer. Different sets of duties do correspond to all these titles, but, titles notwithstanding, you’ll be working with data in one capacity or another. For example, while Data Scientists are engaged with the regressive models that predict a company’s future, Data Analysts are more like statisticians who examine data with an eye to explaining past performance.

Those two concepts, illuminating past performance and predicting future business events, break down the data science field into two macro-categories. Within them lie a variety of jobs (to go with the list of titles above), depending on how you specialize and to which part of the data science process you become attached. You may become an expert in machine learning, for example, and, thus, most of your on-the-job duties will involve working with artificial intelligence. On the other hand, you may end up working with business intelligence software for data visualization, or in any other number of niches. They’re doing a lot with data these days, and coming up with new ways to use it seemingly every day, whence the wide range of opportunities the field provides.

Are Data Science Bootcamps Good for Beginners?

Although there are exceptions, most bootcamps are designed for beginners with no background in computer science beyond the ability to operate one. Indeed, that rather is the entire point of bootcamp education: to train beginners so they’ll be employable in a new, more lucrative, field. There’s no need to be shy about not knowing a mean from a median when you begin a data science bootcamp: you’ll find out pretty quickly, probably on your first day of class. The remarkable thing about a bootcamp is the way in which it can take you from square one all the way through to such complex topics as machine learning in not too much more than a month.

It’s not where you start, but where you finish: even if you had no prior experience with data science when you began your bootcamp, you’ll end it with sufficient knowledge to be able to assume an entry-level role in the field. Your training is going to play an essential role in getting you hired, although any work experience you may have is going to improve your chances as a job candidate. Whatever you did before you signed up for a data science bootcamp taught you how to be a good employee and how to work on a team. Training plus experience plus your apparent willingness to learn should establish you as a strong candidate for any entry-level job in data science.

What Career Services Do Data Science Bootcamps Offer?

Different bootcamps offer different types of career services. Most providers will pair you with someone who can work with you 1-to-1, be it a dedicated career counselor, mentor, or whatever else your school opts to call it. At Noble Desktop, students receive a number of sessions with a mentor with experience working in data science. The time with your mentor is yours to spend as you like: there’s no cookie-cutter pattern that needs to be followed, so, if you need more help with one thing and less with another, you can adjust your mentoring sessions accordingly.

Some schools also offer career services departments that actively seek out job opportunities for which you can apply, although this type of assistance is generally to be found only with the more expensive bottcamps. Other providers have alumni networks upon which they can draw to locate vacant positions, while others bring in alumni and data science veterans to address their students and give them a sneak preview of the job search process and what working as a Data Scientist is like.

Whatever the frosting and sprinkles on top, the actual career services cake is preparing you for the job market by working with you on the documents that lie at the heart of any job search, namely your resume and portfolio. There is more than one way to arrange the salient facts of your professional experience into a cohesive and impressive whole. An expert’s input can be invaluable on what to include and where to put it, even if you’re going to have to tailor your resume for each new application. Your portfolio is the thing that shows HR officers that you know about the technical side of data science from your time in class. It generally features projects you worked on in school, and, again, an expert opinion on how it all should be arranged and where it should be featured is invaluable. In addition to this, any career services department worth its salt will also initiate you into the mysteries of the cover letter, and offer coaching for those interviews (behavioral and technical) you’ll be getting in droves.

What Jobs Will a Data Science Bootcamp Qualify Me For?

You’re not going to be able to start at the top in data science (nor in anything else, for that matter.) Entry-level jobs in the field are usually labeled junior positions, although that’s just a term companies use to arrange their employees into neat boxes. Among the job titles for which you’ll be eligible with a bootcamp education are Junior Data Scientist, Junior Data Engineer, Junior Data Analyst, and further, slightly more specialized positions such as Junior Database Administrator and Junior Machine Learning Analyst.

These roles are beginner versions of frequently encountered job titles, and are designed to bridge the gap between school and work. You’ll learn from your superiors how data science works in the real-world. (An example: in bootcamps, data is usually pre-cleaned before it’s worked on, or, simply because of time constraints, is presented to students as almost workable. In the real-world, unstructured data is just that: a big hodgepodge of all kinds of information, and sorting through it will probably take 75% of the time spent on a real-life data project.) Thus, these aren’t precisely miniature versions of more senior roles: they’re learning positions, as well as occasionally probationary, in that the company that hires you wants to make sure that you’ll fit in and be able to learn on the job.

Can I Freelance After Completing a Data Science Bootcamp?

There are such animals as freelance data scientists, although they don’t usually break free of their corporate shackles before they’ve acquired at least two years’ experience working in the field. You can’t set out a shingle that says “NumPy the Pandas, Data Scientist” right after finishing your bootcamp and expect clients to flock to you. Still, there is definitely a market for freelancers, either to work on special projects or to provide data analysis to companies that can’t afford a full-time data science department.

Freelancing has many advantages over salaried employment: you gain the freedom to work when you want and (often) where you want, especially as a lot of freelance gigs today are remote. That much freedom comes at a price, however, and that price is steady employment. Some people love the freelance lifestyle, but, if you have more risk avoidance than you have risk tolerance, you’re not cut out for being your own boss. If freelancing is your goal, however, you’re going to want to find a bootcamp with a career services department that can help you plant the seeds for the professional network you’re going to need to secure clients when the time comes for you to break out on your own. You should also try to secure a starter job that will set you up with the knowledge and experience to embark on a freelance career. Most freelancers have a particular niche; you’re going to want your work experience to correspond to that niche as closely as possible.

Are Data Science Bootcamps Good for Upskilling?

For someone who is already gainfully employed, a bootcamp is a highly effective way to increase your skill level with an eye to a promotion or a shift in career emphasis. Take the case of someone who’s got experience as a programmer and a degree to match: shifting to data science is a potentially good move, as jobs in the field are abundant despite the fierce competition for them. Despite the education and experience you already have, however, there’s still a skills gap that needs to be filled if you’re to make the switch, and a bootcamp can close that gap, probably more efficiently and in less time than any other method.

You should, however, have a very clear picture of the skills you need to acquire, and then align yourself with a bootcamp that teaches them. Bootcamps are often designed for beginners, and, thus, may not cover the more advanced material you want to learn as an upskiller. You may, in fact, not really need an A-to-Z bootcamp, but, perhaps, a few individual classes in what you need to learn. Many bootcamp providers offer such classes, which sometimes coincide with the more advanced modules of their bootcamps. Noble Desktop, for example, offers a Python for Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp that is much briefer than the certificate program that culminates with those modules

Your employer may even send you to such classes (and pay for them) to upskill current staff rather than taking on new employees. If such an opportunity presents itself, you should definitely take it. No one ever died from having too many marketable skills.

What Does a Data Science Bootcamp Offer over Other Means of Finding a Job?

A data science bootcamp is designed with one purpose in mind: teaching you the skills you need to get a job. This applies across the bootcamp spectrum. Bootcamps differ in how they teach you and prepare you for the job market, but they all share the same common goal. You’ll learn the skills that are currently in-demand, to such an extent that many providers regularly alter their curricula to keep pace with evolving hiring trends.

Undergraduate college degree programs, on the other hand, exist primarily to teach. Their goal is to create graduates who have attained a certain level of knowledge in their chosen field. You go to college to learn, and not necessarily to learn a trade. Although college students today generally have a future career in mind, not every major is designed to dovetail into a specific professional field. With the cost of a college education having gone through the roof, there is a movement towards more marketable degrees (undergraduate business degrees are a comparatively new innovation), but it’s a point of contention as to whether you go to college to get an education or to get a job when you’re through.

That’s not a dichotomy you encounter with bootcamps, which are unequivocally designed to get you a better job than the one you’ve got. Universities generally offer some degree of career assistance, but you’re going to be on your own after you exit university. That’s not going to be the case with a bootcamp, some of which even continue to offer career services throughout their graduates' professional lives."

How to Become a Data Scientist with No Experience: Table of Contents

What Qualifications Do You Need to Be a Data Scientist?

Let’s start with the learning journey. What steps do you need to take?

Our research shows that 91% of data scientists have completed some form of higher education. The list of the most common degrees among employed professionals in the field goes as follows:

Data Science (21%)

Computer Science (18.3%)

Statistics or Maths (16.3%)

Economics and Social Sciences (12.3%)

Others

So, the most obvious answer to the question, “How to get into data science?” is “Get a degree.” If you’re at a point in your life when that is possible, we can recommend the best data science Bachelor’s degrees.

But if that’s not the case, you shouldn’t be discouraged by the numbers. The demand for data scientists is enormous. In fact, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the search for big data and mathematical science specialists will increase by 27.9% from 2016 to 2026.

To examine the level of education among specialists, we conducted a study among 1,000 data scientists. Our results revealed that almost all of them have completed higher education.

However, the number of employed individuals with a bachelor's degree increased from 12% in 2020 to almost 20% in 2021! This shows that employers are starting to value skills more than the number of years spent in education.

That said, you do need both theoretical understanding and practical capabilities to succeed in this field. So, before you begin thinking about how to start a career in data science with no experience, make sure you have the required knowledge.

The Non-Formal Education Path

You don’t necessarily have to invest years and a small fortune in a university degree. Obtaining a certificate from an online course might suffice. If the curriculum is comprehensive, you can learn enough to prepare an impressive portfolio.

That said, the plethora of options available online can be overwhelming. Don’t worry, we can help with that too. We recommend you start by gaining a broader understanding of the data science field and how it adds value to businesses.

Here’s how to do this:

Study various data science terms and their application.

Find out why data plays such an important role in company management and profitability.

Determine how a company can be positioned in order to thrive in a world of data.

Other things you can learn when getting started in data science include:

What types of data analysis techniques are there?

How and why do we apply machine and deep learning algorithms?

and so on...

You might even want to take a few business courses like the one we offer on Data-Driven Growth. This will help you understand how a company creates value and what its current strategic positioning is within a given industry.

Once you’re past this initial stage, it’s time to learn the fundamentals.

Start with fields related to data science that will help you build a solid foundation, like Statistics, Mathematics, and Probability. This will allow you to understand technical topics later on. That way, you won’t simply apply existing frameworks blindly, but will also recognize their limitations and how they were constructed.

Of course, to become a data scientist, you will need to learn how to code. SQL and Python are the two most popular coding languages a data scientist needs. SQL allows you to work with structured databases, while Python gives you the ability to manipulate data and perform in-depth analysis.

Certainly, if you are a beginner in programming, you should learn the basics first. Then, apply what you’ve learned by working on simple projects. Check out our tutorial on the “4 essential Python projects for beginners” to find inspiration for entry-level projects.

At this point, you will be ready to tackle advanced topics, such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and so on. Finally, to showcase those skills, you’ll need data visualization. So, don’t forget to work on this aspect too.

We offer a complete Data Science Career Track, which combines all these topics. It’s a great way to find all relevant subjects in one place and obtain a certificate at the end.

Having a portfolio with projects you completed as part of your studies simply won’t cut it. You need something exceptional to stand out among the hundreds of applicants. We have a detailed guide on creating a portfolio that stands out.

Follow it step by step, and you’ll have an advantage over other people getting started with data science. In it, we cover everything from project ideas to how and where to build a portfolio and even the pitfalls of using Kaggle.

Here’s one extra tip.

Choose projects related to the industry you want to work in. If you’re passionate about a particular cause or job opportunity, you can use datasets or even collect your own data for that specific field.

This kind of effort shows that you’re willing to go above and beyond, and everyone wants to have such a person on their team.

Networking

With social media and online events, networking is easier than ever. This should be an inseparable part of your application process. Shift your mindset from “how to get a data science job” to “how to become a part of the data science world.” One will lead to the other.

Communication with like-minded people is valuable for several reasons.

First, it will help you get into the mind of accomplished professionals. You will familiarize yourself with the way data scientists speak and think, the issues and trending topics in the field, and so on. This will give you confidence during interviews, and the data science interview preparation process won’t seem that daunting.

Second, it can be a great source of support. You can find useful advice on how to become a data scientist – be it help on specific projects or the best places to look for a job.

Lastly, it can be your gateway into the data science world. Many companies have referral systems and use them to find employees. The easiest way to get noticed is through a recommendation from a current employee.

So, reach out to people on forums, go to conferences and networking events, and offer your help and advice when you can. You never know which connection will be the key to finding jobs without experience.

Approach Employers

Don’t rely only on job postings and cold applications. Instead, reach out to hiring managers from the companies you’d like to join and offer to do some free analysis for them. Or even better, perform analysis on their company, industry, product, or competitors and send it to them.

First, this is great practice. But more importantly, it puts your name out there. Even if that doesn’t lead to a job offer, you will expand your network.

Look for Entry-Level Data Scientist Jobs

There are plenty of strategies to find entry-level positions.

For example, consider an unpaid data scientist internship. Approach companies with this offer – even those that have rejected you for a paid position.

Internships and unpaid work are an investment for the future! Once you get your foot in the door, more opportunities will open up. A couple of months of sacrifice may lead you to your dream career.

And if you’re switching from another field and are already employed, you can look for part-time data science jobs to begin with. That way, you can gain experience without sacrificing your financial security.

Consider Working Remotely

Nowadays, many data scientist jobs are remote, so you don’t have to limit your search to employers near you. This is a great strategy for two reasons.

First, salaries tend to vary between locations. Data scientist jobs in NYC, for example, are much better paid than those in, say, Mumbai. Why not earn your salary in the US and spend it in India?

Second, by working remotely, you can broaden your search. That means you can find more entry-level data science jobs, increasing your chances to get hired with no experience.

Build Your Personal Brand

Brand awareness isn’t just for businesses anymore. You need to make yourself recognizable and easily discoverable. This strategy takes some time, but it will help you establish yourself as an expert.

How to do that?

For example, you can start a blog to showcase your skills. You need to show a true passion for the field and a willingness to learn and develop. Good hiring managers will appreciate that.

Also, don’t forget to spread the word on social media as well. Content creation is a great way to get meaningful connections on LinkedIn!

"(""how to become a data scientist"") AND (""no experience"" OR ""entry-level"")",How to Become a Data Scientist (Updated in 2025),https://www.interviewquery.com/p/how-to-become-a-data-scientist,"A question that comes up a lot for new graduates and people transitioning in their careers is, “How much experience do I actually need?”

The majority of professionals in our sample had 2-3 years of professional experience before landing their first data science jobs. Many got that experience through internships or working in a data science adjacent job first.

Here’s a look at both of these career paths:

Of the people who became data scientists, 25% had done an internship before landing their first job.

Internships are huge boosters to your resume. They show value in terms of working in a professional environment and act as professional proof. On a resume, internships command attention and prove experience.

Most data science jobs are like any other kind of credential funnel: the more that you have, the better off you’ll be. But to many hiring managers, internships outrank other credentials like grades, courses, certificates, or projects, because they prove experience in a similar role.

Experience in a Related Data Job

If you want to work as a data scientist… consider taking a job that’s related to data science first. From our research, more than 50% of those who went on to become data scientists worked in another role beforehand.

In fact, Harvard Business Review even dubbed data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century!

But what does a data scientist do? And what do you have to do to land a data scientist position?

If you’re ready to learn how to become a data scientist, then keep reading! I’ll break down exactly how to make the jump to this dream career.

What Does a Data Scientist Do?

Before I go over how to become a data scientist, I want to make sure you have a clear picture of what a data scientist’s role looks like. Data scientists are mid- to senior-level employees who are responsible for organizing and analyzing large amounts of data. They then interpret their findings to create predictions and determine actionable steps for businesses to achieve their goals. And they earn a huge paycheck in the process—as of this article the current average salary for data scientists is $122,359.

If you’re picturing a data scientist alone behind a computer screen all day, that’s not actually accurate. Yes, data scientists must be very analytical (say hello to complex quantitative algorithms!). And yes, they must be intuitive and have the ability to problem-solve. But data scientists must also be quite collaborative and excellent communicators so they can translate their technical findings to non-technical teams.

As Data Governance Specialist Alyssa Columbus says in this Forbes article, “the true impact of a data scientist’s work depends on how well others can understand their insights to take further action and make informed decisions.”

What Does a Data Scientist Job Description Look Like?

A data scientist job description can vary greatly depending on the needs of the company hiring. According to this Harvard Business Review article, the title data scientist covers a wide range of work, “including the massive online experimental frameworks for product development at booking.com and Etsy, the methods Buzzfeed uses to implement a multi-armed bandit solution for headline optimization, and the impact machine learning has on business decisions at Airbnb.”

In terms of responsibilities, that means data scientists may find themselves:

Collecting and cleaning large quantities of data from company databases

Constantly assessing the effectiveness of data collection methods and improving on these methods

Developing and applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and algorithms to mine data

Analyzing the data so it can be used to solve problems and identify opportunities

Using predictive modeling to find trends and patterns that can be used to improve customer experiences and other business outcomes to increase revenue

Clearly communicating findings to executives and other key stakeholders

What Skills Do Data Scientists Need and How Do You Get Them?

If you’re wondering how to become a data scientist, you’ll also need to know which skills to learn. The most in-demand skills are:

Programming languages (Python, R)

Query languages (SQL, Hive, Pig)

NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase)

Big data processing frameworks (Hadoop, Spark)

Data visualization tools (D3.js, GGplot)

Machine learning techniques (regression, decision trees)

Applied statistics (distributions, statistical testing, regression)

Excellent business acumen and strong communication skills, as mentioned above

In order to master the technical skills, you have quite a few options. You can always go back to school and get a Master’s or Ph.D. in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. But what if you don’t have the time or resources to enroll in such a program? In that case, a data scientist bootcamp may be a good option.

A data scientist bootcamp is an intensive, immersive program that lasts around 3-6 months. After completion, a student will have a portfolio of completed work and should feel ready to apply for an entry-level data scientist position.

Some data scientist bootcamp options include BrainStation, Flatiron School, and General Assembly, which all offer full-time, part-time, and online options. Before enrolling, you may need to have some foundational skills under your belt, including applied mathematics and statistics, so be sure to be aware of these requirements when determining which bootcamp is right for you.

If you’re not ready to fully jump into a bootcamp program, you can also start by focusing on learning one or two skills to get you started. For instance, you can begin building up your skills by taking our self-paced Python for Web Apps & Data course. Python is an extremely versatile programming language, so if you end up realizing data science isn’t for you, Python is still a marketable skill to have on your resume!

How to Land a Data Scientist Job

Once you have the data scientist skills you’ll need, it’s time to land a data scientist job! What are the best ways to prepare and find the right position for you? Let’s take a look.

Network With the Data Scientist Community

Networking is a powerful way to make real, face-to-face connections with other data scientists, and it’s something that can be done even before you’re ready to start job hunting. You can use sites like Meetup.com to find data scientist events in your area. Or you can attend a data scientist conference like the Strata Conference or the Knowledge Discovery in Data Science Conference (KDD).

The earlier you start making connections, the easier time you’ll have when you’re ready to find a data scientist job.

Apply for Data Scientist Jobs

Once you have the skills and portfolio to prove it, start applying for jobs and preparing for interviews! The usual suspects like Glassdoor and Indeed are always good job boards, but you can also look at Data Elixir, DataJobs, or the Data Analytics Association, which are job sites specifically geared toward data science-related jobs. Working with a recruiter who specializes in data science is also something to keep in mind.

And if you’re having feelings of self-doubt or imposter syndrome, know that it’s completely normal to feel that way! Like Columbus says, “If you don’t meet all of a job’s requirements, apply anyway. You don’t have to know every skill (e.g., programming languages) on a job description, especially if there are more than ten listed. If you’re a great fit for the main requirements of the job’s description, you need to apply.”

It’s also helpful to treat each application and interview as a learning process. You’ll get a better idea of which skills employers are truly looking for each time you apply and/or interview. And if you’re lacking any of them, you’ll know what to focus on to be better qualified for the next job you apply for.

Hopefully you now have more clarity on how to become a data scientist. Making the transition will take serious effort, but the payoffs can be huge: a satisfying career in a growing field and an impressive paycheck to go along with it!"

"(""data science curriculum"" OR ""AI course design"") AND (university OR bootcamp OR college)",A design framework for creating AI courses in different disciplines,https://ki-campus.org/blog/kursdesign-framework,"The use of Artificial Intelligence has become key in numerous domains, emphasizing the need for education in this field. The interdisciplinary nature of AI and its relevance across various sectors call for an integration of AI topics into university curricula. In this blog post, Johannes Schleiss introduces the ""AI Course Design Planning Framework"", a comprehensive tool designed to structure the development of domain-specific AI courses at the university level.

Setting the scene

The increasing importance of AI in today's world is undeniable. AI applications span healthcare, finance, technology, and many more industries, making AI education essential. The call for more AI education is evident in multiple contexts (Laupichler et al., 2022).

Different types of AI education

At the same time, it is important to recognize that there are different types of AI education. In the context of this blog, we distinguish between (1) AI literacy education, providing the foundations to everyone, (2) expert AI education laying the foundation for research and (3) domain-specific AI education offering education at the intersection of AI and domains. While the first two got quite some attention, the latter offers great potential in bringing AI education to different domains (Schleiss et al., 2023).

Domain-specific AI education

There are three reasons domain-specific AI education matters:

Interdisciplinary Relevance: AI intersects with various fields. Integrating AI education in the domain helps students understand how AI can be applied in their respective domains. Enhancing Employability: Graduates well-versed in the application of AI in their domain have a competitive edge in the job market. Fostering Innovation: AI education can inspire students to develop AI-driven solutions for real-world challenges.

Challenges in domain-specific AI education

At the same time, domain-specific AI education is challenging for both learners and educators. Learners come from different disciplines and thus bring different prior knowledge and skills. Educators teaching at the intersection of AI and their domain need to bridge two fields. Teaching a domain-specific AI course requires a thorough (self-)reflection of instructors’ competencies in AI and their role in the learning process.



AI Course Design Planning Framework

The following gives a short overview of the categories.

How does it work?



The AI Course Design Planning Framework forms a visual and practical tool for instructors and course developers in the higher education or professional education context with a special focus on non-computer science (non-CS) students. It can be used as a means to gather ideas, innovate, plan and communicate ideas for domain-specific AI courses.



The framework can be used as a self-contained instrument for individuals, in tandem with AI and domain experts or in a workshop setting with multiple people. We suggest filling it from left to right, first considering the questions on AI in the domain, the learning environment of the course and last, the course implementation.



Three steps towards better AI education for all

Try it for yourself

Experimenting is better than reading, so we are excited to have you try it and share your experience. You can download an empty canvas here. Share the results

We are building up a database of filled frameworks to make it easier for everyone to build AI courses for students. If you want to contribute your filled framework, you can send it to johannes.schleiss@ovgu.de. Take part in follow-up studies

Program Requirements

The Master of Information and Data Science is designed to be completed in 20 months, but other options are available to complete the program on an accelerated basis. You will complete 27 units of coursework over three to five terms1. Courses are 3 units each, and divided into foundation courses, advanced courses, and a synthetic capstone. You will also complete an immersion at the UC Berkeley campus.

The curriculum prepares students to ask good questions of data by defining (and refining) business or research questions that are relevant and tractable in order to use data to inform decision making. You will learn best practices for data collection and engineering — and how these factors affect timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of large-scale storage models.

Students learn to apply the latest statistical and computational methods for identifying patterns, extracting insights, and making predictions from complex data sets. You will be given the opportunity to hone your skills in effectively communicating findings of data analysis and dealing with the ethical dilemmas and legal requirements associated with working with real-world data at scale.

The program’s courses are divided into foundation courses, advanced courses, and a capstone.

Program Paths

The MIDS program consists of 27 units and can be completed on one of three paths: accelerated, standard, or decelerated. Students who wish to take the program on an accelerated or decelerated basis must receive approval from UC Berkeley.

The accelerated path gives students the opportunity to take three courses per semester to complete the program in as few as 12 months.

The standard path is designed for working professionals and can be completed in 20 months, with two courses per semester.

The decelerated path allows students to drop down to one course per semester after the first term and complete the program in no more than 32 months.

Foundation Courses

Students who are proficient in object oriented programming and pass the Introduction to Data Science Programming waiver exam will complete 12 units of foundation coursework, 12 units of advanced coursework and the synthetic capstone course.

Students who are not proficient in object oriented programming or do not pass the waiver exam are required to complete the Introduction to Data Science Programming foundation course as part of their 15 units of foundation coursework, 9 units of advanced coursework and the capstone course.

Advanced Courses

Capstone Course

MIDS students apply their skills by delivering a culminating capstone project that integrates the core concepts developed throughout the program. The capstone challenges students to combine the technical, analytical, strategic, and communication abilities to design and execute a full data science project. Through real-world application, students build the expertise needed for long-term success in data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and related fields.

Immersion

While all courses are delivered online, students are required to attend at least one, 3–4 day immersion on the UC Berkeley campus or in other locations relevant to data science. During the immersion, Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) students benefit from meeting classmates and professors in person, participating in workshops, and networking with other data science professionals. Immersions are crafted to deliver additional learning, networking, and community-building opportunities to MIDS students.

Institution is a place where teacher explains and student just understands and learns the lesson. Every student has his own definition for toughness and easiness and there isn’t any absolute scale for measuring knowledge but examination score indicate the performance of student. In this case study, knowledge of data mining is combined with educational strategies to improve students’ performance. Generally, data mining (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of analysing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information. Data mining software is one of a number of analytical tools for data. It allows users to analyse data from many different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarize the relationships identified. Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational database. Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).This project describes the use of clustering data mining technique to improve the efficiency of academic performance in the educational institutions .In this project, a live experiment was conducted on students .By conducting an exam on students of computer science major using MOODLE(LMS) and analysing that data generated using RapidMiner(Datamining Software) and later by performing clustering on the data. This method helps to identify the students who need special advising or counselling by the teacher to give high quality of education."

Beyond AI: The New Essential Skills Reshaping Student Success (Research by Manuel Barbosa de Oliveira)

In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, students find themselves at a fascinating crossroads. The traditional skills that once formed the bedrock of education - memorizing facts, producing standard reports, completing routine tasks - are giving way to something far more profound. Instead, students must become fluent in a new language: the language of AI literacy . This means not just understanding how to use AI tools, but truly grasping their potential and limitations, much like a craftsperson understanding their tools while recognizing when to rely on human touch instead.

But this is just the beginning of their journey. The heart of modern education lies in developing what AI cannot easily replicate: higher-order thinking skills that define human intelligence . Students are now challenged to think critically, solve complex problems, and create innovative solutions in ways that machines cannot. It's like developing a mental toolkit where each tool - from analytical thinking to creative problem-solving - serves a unique purpose that complements, rather than competes with, artificial intelligence.

Perhaps most crucially, adaptability has become the cornerstone of student success . In this new educational frontier, students must learn to be agile thinkers, capable of navigating an ever-changing technological landscape. They need to develop what we might call ""intellectual flexibility"" - the ability to not just work alongside AI, but to think deeply about how they think, understanding their own learning processes and explaining their reasoning . This represents a fundamental shift from being passive receivers of knowledge to becoming active architects of their understanding, preparing them for a future where the ability to adapt and think creatively is more valuable than ever.

The effort to develop the new degree program was led by Mathematics Professor Annie Yi Han and started with a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded curriculum project, “Creating Data Science Pathway for STEM Students Success.”

“The creation of the Data Science associate degree program at BMCC is an excellent example of the high-quality academic product a faculty team can produce together,” says Professor Han, who served as Principal Investigator (PI) of the NSF grant alongside four Co-PIs and one key personnel member.

The Co-PIs followed by their area of focus in the project included Mathematics Professors Glenn Miller (curriculum development), Elisabeth Jaffe (recruitment), Oleg Muzician (OER Lab), Jorgé Florez (student success) and Stephen Featherstongaugh (online homework).

Curriculum project reimagines existing mathematics courses and creates data science courses

The curriculum development project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) was led by Mathematics Professor Glenn Miller.

“What we did in the curriculum development phase of the project was to redesign and infuse data science concepts into five existing mathematics courses, as well as create four new data science courses,” says Dr. Han.

He adds that graduates of the A.S. in Data Science program will be prepared for a seamless transfer to the Data Science track in the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) program in Applied Mathematics at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY.

“In addition, we are also pursuing an agreement with New York City College of Technology, CUNY,” he says, and addsthat career options for those holding a degree in data science “are varied and lucrative.”

Career opportunities for graduates with Data Science degrees are dramatically expanding

“Because of the dramatic growth in data used in science, business, government and other fields, employers are in great need of applicants who possess a combination of skills,” says Dr. Miller.

These skills include programming ability, as well as the analytical skills to sort through “mountains of data to find relationships between variables and to ultimately contribute to industry-changing, data-driven decisions.”

He gives an example. “The rise of artificial intelligence presents one application of large data sets. They can be used to develop systems that will drive decision-making and solve problems dynamically and analytically.”

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for jobs involving data science will increase by 33% over the next three years, better than for most other careers.

The work of data scientists to prepare data for analysis is constantly evolving to accommodate an expanding scope of applications.

Some examples include detecting bias in loan application approvals, detecting credit card fraud, measuring climate change in order to drive legislative efforts, and much more.

Graduates with advanced degrees in data science are prepared for careers as an analyst in the areas of data, business or finance. They become machine learning engineers, data engineers, data architects and more.

Innovative pedagogy fuels open-source online homework system, Data Science Open Lab and student research projects

The four new courses developed for the A.S. in Data Science program in the Mathematics department are Probability and Statistics for Data Science (MAT 409), Linear Algebra for Data Science (MAT 415), Introduction to Machine Learning (MAT 420) and Python Programming (CSC 203).

In addition to Professor Glenn Miller, Mathematics professors who participated in curriculum development for the new degree program include David Allen, Elizabeth Jaffe, Karl Levy, Adam Li, Jaewoo Li and Micah Miller.

Pedagogical innovations that are part of the new curriculum include an open-source online homework system developed by Professor Stephen Featherstonhaugh. “As an OER developer, I play an important role in reducing costs and increasing accessibility for Data Science majors.”

The Data Science Open Lab project was led by Professor Oleg Muzician, who created Data Science Python lab projects for calculus course and Linear Algebra for Data Science with tutorial videos for the instructors.

A framework for student research projects was developed by Jorgé Florez.

“As a Student Success Coordinator,” he says, “I am committed to engaging our students in internship and research activities in Data Science in order to prepare them for a wide range of future careers in the data science fields.”

Guided pathway supports student success in this high-demand STEM discipline

According to project materials, the Data Science pathway will support undergraduate STEM education by expanding equity and inclusion in the field of Data Science.

To achieve this goal, BMCC will help students successfully transition from lower-division to upper-division coursework in data science and encourage the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in a wide range of STEM-related disciplines.

By following a guided pathway model, the Data Science degree program “provides a curriculum which is highly structured and meshes with the program at the four-year college curriculum with which we have articulation,” says Dr. Miller.

He explains that following a guided pathway also ensures pedagogical consistency in the online homework part of the program, as well as with applications used in lab sessions, and with student participation in faculty-led research projects.

The guided data Science pathway starts with a student recruitment activity led by Co-PI and Professor Elisabeth Jaffe.

“In my role, I will be recruiting students into the data science major and working with them to foster and understand the value of a ‘growth mindset,’” a belief that with the right supports and opportunities in place, every student can learn and achieve their academic goals.

“By majoring in data science, students will be able to enter the workforce in a diverse range of careers for which the national demand is very rapidly increasing,” says Dr. Jaffe. “By having a growth mindset, students will be well prepared for any challenge they face in their pursuit of this degree.”

As Dr. Han points out, “In the end, this guided pathway approach is intended to guide our students successfully through the program. It’s a unique approach in this particular STEM discipline of data science, in that it aims to improve the success of students from diverse backgrounds who have struggled in such fields in the past.”"

""Job demand is very high in data science, so it's a high priority for our department,"" said Yixin Chen, chair of the Department of Computer and Information Science. ""About four years ago, we created a data science emphasis and a data science minor, which were both very successful.

""We saw the potential for growth and increased industry need, so we began developing a bachelor's degree program in response two years ago.""

Yixin Chen

The Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning recently approved the program, which will welcome its inaugural class in fall 2024.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of data science occupations was expected to grow by 35% from 2022 to 2023, which is much faster than average.

Data scientists use statistical methods, machine learning and advanced data analysis techniques to extract insights from complex data sets.

A bachelor's degree in data science will give graduates flexibility to seek jobs in virtually any field, said Timothy Holston, instructional assistant professor and assistant chair of computer and information science.

""The need is for people who have computational skills as well as training in a particular subject,"" Holston said. ""For instance, a data scientist trained in journalism could assist in fact-finding missions to determine what news is real and what's false.""

Other applications include predicting patient outcomes in health care, personalizing customer experiences in retail and optimizing service quality in telecommunications, he said.

To that end, the curriculum will incorporate courses in a focus area of a student's choosing.

Timothy Holston

""This will allow students to use the skills that they've learned in the data science intro courses and apply them to a specific area,"" Holston said. ""The coursework also revolves around the application of mathematics. Data science can be heavily math-influenced.""

A significant number of current computer science students are opting to enroll in the data science program, but the degree is open to anyone, he said.

The department's next step is to pursue accreditation through ABET, which is the accrediting body for all Ole Miss engineering programs, Chen said.

""Once the first students have graduated, we can begin the accreditation process,"" he said. ""We have a well-defined curriculum, and we are all excited about the first group of incoming students.""

"(""new data science program"" OR ""ML certificate course"") AND (Coursera OR university OR bootcamp)",MU Data Science: Empowering Students One Dataset at a Time,https://www.methodist.edu/news/mu-data-science-empowering-students-one-dataset-at-a-time/,"When Charles Gaffney first enrolled at Methodist University, he wasn’t sure what path he would take. With the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and data-driven decision-making shaping nearly every industry, he saw an opportunity not only to stay ahead of the curve − but to help others understand the world more clearly. This year, Gaffney makes history as Methodist University’s first in the Data Science major.

“I wanted to learn how to present data in ways people can understand,” Gaffney said. “Whether it’s social media, news, or current events − data is everywhere. I wanted to make sure I knew how to analyze and interpret that information.”

The new Data Science program at MU is already proving that the numbers don’t lie − not only by launching the major but, also by attracting students from related fields who see the value of adding a minor. William Johnston, a Computer Science major, said the minor allowed him to specialize in an area he had long been passionate about. “I’ve always been interested in the data side of computer science,” he said. “The minor helped me get deeper into that, in a way my main courses hadn’t before.”

Nour Diab, a Mathematics major, shared a similar story. “I enjoyed the coding part of my math major, and the Data Science minor added another dimension,” she said. “It brought in visualization and programming, which helped me better understand how math plays out in real-world data.”

While Gaffney holds the title of the first graduate in the major, it’s clear he won’t be the last. More students are beginning to recognize the career possibilities this field opens up − especially with academic guidance from MU’s One Stop (Academic & Career Support Services).

Amber King, an academic and career advisor at One Stop, has been instrumental in helping students navigate the new program. “This group was easy,” she said with a laugh. “They were already on top of their course work, so incorporating Data Science into their plans was a smooth process. Our goal here isn’t just helping students register for classes − we help them build a plan that reflects their goals.”

King emphasized that One Stop’s doors are always open. “Students don’t have to come in with everything figured out,” she said. “We’re here to help them explore, discover, and access the resources they need to succeed − whether that’s tutoring, advising, or connecting them with career pathways.”

For Diab, the support made all the difference. “Ms. Amber helped me figure out how to expand my opportunities,” she said. “She was someone I could count on as I added more classes and shaped my path forward.”

Department Chair, & Professor of Mathematics Kathy Fick says the push to launch the Data Science major came from the needs of the modern world. “We are living in a data-driven society. Being able to interpret and use data meaningfully − across industries like health, education, the arts, and beyond − is essential,” she said. “Data science is interdisciplinary at its core, combining math, computer science, and statistics. It equips students with tools that matter, no matter their passion.”

Fick credits the program’s early success to students like Gaffney, Johnston, and Diab. “They’ve been just as excited about this program as I have,” she said. “They’ve helped shape how the courses are built and how the program will grow.”

Growth is exactly what Fick envisions next. “Right now, most of our students come from Math and Computer Science,” she said. “But I want to see this expand to health informatics, education, humanities − everywhere. Data touches every field, and our students should feel empowered to use it in the areas they care about most.”

As Methodist University sends off its first Data Science graduate, one thing is clear − this program isn’t just about numbers. It’s about opportunity, insight, and empowering students to shape the future − one dataset at a time."

Artificial intelligence in compulsory level of education: perspectives from Namibian in-service teachers Journal Article Scopus WoS Crossref: 14 Cloneria Nyambali Jatileni, Ismaila Temitayo Sanusi, Sunday Adewale Olaleye, Musa Adekunle Ayanwale, Friday Joseph Agbo, Peter B. Oyelere AbstractWith the push to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) from kindergarten to twelfth-grade levels comes a need for equipped teachers. However, there needs to be more initiative in professional learning opportunities, which demands the required effort to ensure teachers learn the AI content they will be teaching. To design an effective professional development program, understanding teachers' existing knowledge, interest and disposition towards AI is crucial to devise strategies that could best support the teachers. As a result, this study aims to investigate in-service teachers' perspectives of teaching AI in schools from the perspective of planned behavior theory. Using a 7-factor scale of AI Anxiety, AI Readiness, AI Relevance, Attitude towards using AI, AI for Social Good, Confidence in AI and Behavioral Intention. This study sampled 159 in-service teachers in Namibia. The teachers' responses were analyzed with SmartPLS using Structural Equation Modelling and various Multigroup Analysis techniques. This study found that teachers' behavioral intention to teach AI depends on a combination of factors, including the relevance of AI, attitude towards using AI, the use of AI for social good and confidence. Meanwhile, AI Anxiety and readiness could not be linked to the intention to teach AI. We discussed our findings, highlighted the study implication, and suggested future directions.

A systematic review of teaching and learning machine learning in K-12 education Journal Article Scopus WoS Crossref: 91 Ismaila Temitayo Sanusi, Solomon Sunday Oyelere, Henriikka Vartiainen, Jarkko Suhonen, Markku Tukiainen AbstractThe increasing attention to Machine Learning (ML) in K-12 levels and studies exploring a different aspect of research on K-12 ML has necessitated the need to synthesize this existing research. This study systematically reviewed how research on ML teaching and learning in K-12 has fared, including the current area of focus, and the gaps that need to be addressed in the literature in future studies. We reviewed 43 conference and journal articles to analyze specific focus areas of ML learning and teaching in K-12 from four perspectives as derived from the data: curriculum development, technology development, pedagogical development, and teacher training/professional development. The findings of our study reveal that (a) additional ML resources are needed for kindergarten to middle school and informal settings, (b) further studies need to be conducted on how ML can be integrated into subject domains other than computing, (c) most of the studies focus on pedagogical development with a dearth of teacher professional development programs, and (d) more evidence of societal and ethical implications of ML should be considered in future research. While this study recognizes the present gaps and direction for future research, these findings provide insight for educators, practitioners, instructional designers, and researchers into K-12 ML research trends to advance the quality of the emerging field.

Investigating the moderating effects of social good and confidence on teachers' intention to prepare school students for artificial intelligence education Journal Article Scopus WoS Crossref: 24 Ismaila Temitayo Sanusi, Musa Adekunle Ayanwale, Thomas K. F. Chiu AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) has triggered profound reforms across industries, including education. These developments necessitate the inclusion of AI as a subject in K-12 classrooms. However, the need for students to learn AI demands that educators pay increasing attention, believe in its relevance and intend to promote it among their students and colleagues. This paper aimed to explore teachers' perceptions of and behavioral intention to teach AI. We specifically considered the association of AI anxiety, perceived usefulness, attitude towards AI, AI relevance, AI readiness, and behavioral intention factors. This research further aims to examine the moderator effect of AI for social good and confidence on the relationship in our hypothesized research model. To address this purpose, a quantitative methodology with the use of structural equation modeling was utilized. Data were retrieved through an online questionnaire from 320 lower and upper secondary school in-service teachers, mostly in STEM-related fields. Our findings reveal that teacher perceptions of AI for social good and confidence will affect most relationships in the model. Teacher professional programs should include the benefits and risks of AI and good practice sharing. DOI: 10.1007/s10639-023-12250-1 2023 , Education and Information Technologies , № 1 , p. 273-295"

PRE-SERVICE PRESCHOOL AND PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS' POSITION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Vincentas Lamanauskas 15th International Scientific Conference on Distance Learning in Applied Informatics. DiVAI 2024, 2025 Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing extremely rapidly, and the ways of its use and application are becoming extremely diverse. It is obvious that AI is becoming one of the main drivers of productivity and competitive advantage, including in education. It follows that a common understanding of the whole community is necessary of the fundamentals of AI, i.e., how it works, what are its main capabilities and limitations when applying and/or using tools based on it. The need to review educational priorities, the content of teaching/studies, invest in teaching/studies infrastructure and teacher qualifications is simply necessary. AI provides a lot of possibilities in the education sector, and future teachers, having learnt how to use these tools, will be able to teach their students more effectively and creatively. Therefore, it is important to know future preschool and primary school teachers’ position in the field of AI. In the months of March-April 2024, an informative-descriptive study was conducted, in which 112 university students, future teachers took part. The study did not seek to prove any causal relationships between the variables, but simply to assess the situation with respect to the characteristics of interest. Research data were collected using a written survey (questionnaire). The analysis of the collected data was carried out using the main measures of descriptive statistics. It has been established that students’ familiarity with AI is moderate, and their interest in professional development about the use of AI for teaching/learning is very high. Students adequately assess their understanding/competencies in the field of AI technologies; however, they do not perceive a significant AI impact on personal academic performance. Ethical aspects are considered to be the most important in the field of AI, while the application of AI in the organisation of lessons is not considered to be a very important area. Critical thinking has been found to be best developed using AI, while logical thinking, creativity, and problem solving are least developed. It is important to implement AI in education carefully and to accurately assess its impact in order to maximally use its benefits and minimise negative effects. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right

SOUTH AFRICAN TEACHERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF THE ADOPTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE CLASSROOM Charli Wiggill MEd ICT Dissertation, 2024 This study aims to investigate the perceptions of South African teachers regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in their classrooms. Existing South African research on perceptions regarding AI focuses largely on information technology and computer science teachers, while most other studies addressing this subject are foreign. This qualitative research is necessary to establish the readiness and capacity of local K-12 teachers towards the adoption of AI in South African schools. Following the purposeful selection of participants, semi-structured interviews were conducted with K-12 teachers from both public and independent schools across the country, including primary and high schools, as well as teachers with varying years of experience. Findings indicate the teachers interviewed are open to the adoption of AI in their classrooms. Furthermore, the degree of buy-in and readiness to the implementation of AI by those interviewed has little to do with preconceived notions such as age or gender. However, while there is an inclination for innovation, there are also significant hurdles to overcome, including resource limitations, training needs, and ethical considerations. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right"

"(""teaching AI in schools"" OR ""data science in universities"") AND (""course content"" OR ""syllabus update"")",Uncategorized Archives,https://eigenvector.com/category/uncategorized/,"We started running “how to” webinars with our chemometrics software in the Fall of 2019. When COVID hit we decided to step up the frequency of these, and to add short courses. Up to now we’ve done ten webinars and five short courses running from 2-5 days each. Both have been quite popular. We’ve had as many as 200 people online for the webinars and 80 for some of our classes.

Having had a positive experience, (over 98% of respondents to our post class surveys say they are likely or highly likely to recommend our online courses), one of our short course attendees asked if I would provide our advice on running these online events. I was happy to do so, then realized that there are others out there that might benefit from our experience. So here it is!

Participant’s On-screen View of a Webinar

Eigenvector Research has never had a central office. We’ve all worked from home for 25+ years now. We started using WebEx to talk to each other long ago, so when we had to choose a platform for webinars we stuck with it. We’ve had good luck with WebEx as a platform. It is maybe a little old and clunky compared to Zoom, (and we wish they’d stop changing their interface), but it is definitely industrial strength and has not been plagued with security issues like Zoom. We don’t do Zoom at Eigenvector.

We record our webinars and classes (more on that below) but we’ve found that people really prefer to attend the live sessions. Besides the possibility of asking questions, there’s just a better connection to the speaker and the content when you’re watching live.

For all our online events we have three key positions, the host, the moderator and the speaker(s). The host is responsible for starting the meeting, controlling who is the current presenter, and introducing the speaker and moderator.

With big groups it really doesn’t work to have people ask questions verbally; it creates too much chaos. We have participants ask questions through the chat feature and the moderator monitors the chat. The moderator then decides what questions to pass to the speaker and when would be a good time to interrupt. Usually, we have the moderator go over these “rules” when he is first introduced.

The speaker or speakers, of course, deliver the main content of the webinar. Having the moderator filter the chat questions for the speaker works well. For shorter talks questions could be held to the end, but interruptions are actually good. When you speak too long on a WebEx without feedback you begin to feel pretty disconnected. So relevant interruptions are welcome. And for these audience, it makes things a lot less monotone to have some back and forth between the moderator and speaker.

I would advise speakers against trying to monitor the chat as they talk. It’s too distracting, better to have the moderator do that. And it’s really great if collaborators of the talk being presented are online at the same time to help answer questions through the chat. There are usually several Eigenvectorians in attendance that can answer questions in the chat that really don’t need to go to the speaker, such as questions specific to the person asking and not that useful for all the participants. And they often provide links to supplementary material that can be quite useful.

Before any online event be sure to practice with the roles and make sure everyone is on board with procedures. It is especially good to practice how to pass presenter privileges and how to activate screen sharing mode. Also, test the audio! We’ve found that headsets work best. Even cheap ones are way better than using your computer microphone.

Speakers should always present their slides in “Presentation” mode so they fill the screen. It’s important that things be as large as possible when transmitted because they get shrunk into a smaller window on the participant’s end (see photo above). And definitely have speakers make up the slides in “Widescreen” format. If you use the old format you get wasted black space on either side of the presentation. If they are going to do anything on their own screen, e.g. software demos, they should change their screen resolution to something lower than native, like 1600 x 900, so everything on it is bigger. Otherwise it can hardly be seen on the participant’s end.

When demoing software, be sure to go slow. Explain what you are doing in words. Hover over buttons while dithering the cursor before clicking. Rest momentarily on fly-out menus before selecting. We’ve been pleased to find that about 75% of the participants that attempt to follow along with our software demos at home are able to do so, but we are working to make that even better!

In WebEx you should have the “Mute on Entry” turned on and “Anyone can share” turned off. Even so you’ll find that people will get their microphones turned back on so you need to have the host or somebody with host privileges ready to track these people down and mute them.

We use video sparingly because it eats up people’s bandwidth. I would suggest that the moderator and speakers turn theirs on right at the beginning just to let people see there are live people on the other end, but then turn it off once they get going.

Unless you are prepared for a big bill, when preparing the WebEx meeting invitation make sure you turn off the setting that gives out the toll-free number. That gets billed back to the WebEx account holder and if you have a lot of international’s participants it adds up fast. We got a $1200 phone bill after doing our first Basic Chemometrics PLUS Metabolomics class. Ouch!

We use the features in WebEx to record the sessions. These good quality but they include all the windows around the speakers screen. So we edit them and crop off the surrounding material before posting them. We use iMovie but there are many other options. It takes a while for WebEx to make the recordings available, in our experience up to 8 hours, so in the end it takes about a day to get them downloaded, edited and posted online.

We tried YouTube and Vimeo for our videos and definitely preferred Vimeo. It’s pretty easy to create “Showcases” of related videos in Vimeo, and to password protect them. (We record all our courses and make the videos available to participants in a password protected Showcase.) Vimeo also provides good analytics on viewership and it’s easy to embed the videos in web pages. For some examples, see our Webinar Series page.

We often provide supplementary videos that are posted with the recorded live events. We use Snagit to record our non-live videos and have had really good luck with it. There are many other options of course.

The chat sessions can be saved and provided along with the recorded videos but they may have to be edited. The saved chat from the host includes all the messages that were sent privately between the host and other individuals. But sometimes there is some valuable stuff in them. It is hard to remember to save them, however, and in WebEx they are very hard to retrieve after the fact!

Of course the MOST important key to a successful online event is to have content that people actually want to see. We’ll leave it to you to figure that out! Good luck with your online endeavors!

Artificial Intelligence In Education

Artificial intelligence can be used through adaptive learning programs, games, and software, It can help students to work at their own pace, AI will impact education through the application of greater levels of individualized learning, Educational software can be adapted to student needs.



AI can be used in many activities in education, such as grading, In college, grading homework and tests for large lecture courses can be tedious work, teachers find that grading takes up a significant amount of time, that could be used to interact with students, prepare for class, or work on professional development, teachers can automate grading for all kinds of multiple choice & fill-in-the-blank testing.

AI can point out places where online courses need to improve, When a large number of students are found to submit a wrong answer to a homework assignment, the system alerts the teacher and presents future students a customized message that offers hints to the correct answer.

Students can get additional support from AI tutors, while human tutors can offer that machines can’t, Some tutoring programs based on artificial intelligence exist and can help students through basic mathematics, writing, and other subjects, AI programs can teach students fundamentals, but so far aren’t ideal for helping students learn high-order thinking and creativity.

Artificial Intelligence can offer feedback about the success of the course as a whole, It can help teachers and students to craft courses that are customized to their needs, students will get all the necessary knowledge, Some schools are using AI systems to monitor student progress and to alert professors when there might be an issue with student performance.

AI-based systems have changed how we interact with information, They can be instead of schools, They offer superb skills that students always need, Intelligent system helps find and use information in schools & academia as well, It can help students improve learning, and maybe a substitute for real-world tutoring, Teachers will supplement AI lessons, assist students who are struggling, AI can offer human interaction and hands-on experiences for students.

An intelligent computer system is designed to help students to learn basic skills from anywhere in the world at any time, Educational programs powered by AI may replace teachers in some instances, It can alter higher education, AI tutors can offer solutions for learning improvement, AI is the perfect format for supporting this kind of learning, as AI systems learn by trial-and-error method.



AI systems can read students handwriting & grade their exams, This is achieved by using a concept known as computer vision where computers are trained to read images, such systems will fight cheating & plagiarism, AI systems can predict the future performance of a student by looking at their performance over time, AI will help the Ministry of Education know how many students are expected to join the secondary school and university at a certain year.

Natural language processing is the ability of a computer to understand human language, It can be used to analyze course content and uncover learning gaps in the curriculum, AI system can uncover the student’s areas of weakness and suggest content to help them improve, It can discover the best delivery models for students.

AI systems can analyze the syllabus and course material and come up with new and customized content, It can generate exams after analyzing this content, By analyzing student data, AI systems can pair up students based on their personality, strengths and complementary skills, Grouping students who can work together will reduce conflict and make the learning process smooth and efficient.

Artificial Intelligence Tutors can offer additional support to students & they can give them feedback in their studies, They will make on-demand learning for students possible, So, students don’t have to be confined in a class setting to conduct their studies, AI technology can increase tech experience for students, The use of artificial intelligence shows the power of tech & coding, and it might encourage kids to learn STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math).



Smart Schools will be built based on the internet, They will connect various devices to the internet, The devices will communicate with each other and monitor things such as alarms, lighting and maintenance needs before they happen, Smart classrooms will invigilate exams & curb cheating, The classrooms will be configured with facial recognition technology that will monitor student attendance and tell how long the student spent in a particular class session.

AI tutors advantages

Artificial Intelligence helps make education more comfortable, It lets the kid choose literally everything: the learning pace, the curriculum, the form of education, and the educator, Teachers can collect insights about every student they teach, develop an individualized approach, and handle the toughest kids easier, It is possible to create adapted groups whose skills and motivation match the project and work with them.

Artificial Intelligence is perfect, It is not prone to human error, so, the knowledge it shares is right, AI doesn’t need to take breaks, so, every student can contact a virtual tutor whenever he needs academic assistance, Advances in Artificial Intelligence provide teachers with a better understanding of how their students learn and allowing them to customize the curriculum accordingly.



AI technology provides people with experiences they didn’t have a chance to try before, It can bring down the language gap for foreign students, the challenge of education is extremely tough for the kids of emigrants, Artificial intelligence is a way to resolve the issue and translate the words of the teacher to a foreigner in a real-time mode.

Artificial Intelligence can save time by outsourcing repetitive tasks, with the use of bots and AI-technology, learning can turn into a fun and engaging experience, Artificial Intelligence presents a few possibilities that can make the education of disabled students easier, From virtual presence devices that can let the kid attend the classroom to virtual classroom and teachers that create a unique studying experience, now the world of knowledge can be brought everywhere.

ITS (Intelligent Tutoring Systems) can function without the teacher having to be present and can challenge and support the learner using different algorithms, By analyzing learner information, Artificial Intelligence can generate groups suited to a certain task, or groups that balance one learner’s weaknesses with another learner’s strengths.

Artificial Intelligence can analyze patterns in which a large number of students submit wrong answers to the same questions, By alerting the educator to these patterns, AI can help make teachers more effective, It can learn students’ habits and propose the most efficient study schedule for them, Robots won’t get bored, tired or need a break and If the machine encounters a problem or question out of its programming a human will be contacted to step in.

Robots are cost-efficient and can work 24 hours, seven days a week in those repetitive and time-consuming tasks no human enjoys doing, It can save teachers time and give a more realistic overview of a child’s achievements in school, translation apps are not as accurate as human translation, but machine translation can be faster and more efficient.

AI tutors disadvantages

Robot teachers come with a high cost of power, If every school gets a robot, the amount of power it has to use will increase, countries will have to spend more budget to cover the expenses, and electrical power is a non-renewable resource, Educational programs powered by AI work by the algorithms that are not influenced by the repetition of the task, So, their experience doesn’t matter and doesn’t make them any better.



Artificial Intelligence can stimulate technology addiction, With tech implemented in every classroom, kids won’t be able to imagine their lives without it, they rely on machines to make everyday tasks more efficient, So, we risk technology addiction, we’ll get a bunch of socially-unadapted technology-addicted adults.

Although Artificial intelligence improves the education experience, Relying too much on these machines to grade or tutor may lead to educational oversights that hurt learners more than help, Making teaching more efficient could create less of a demand for educators, the implementation of AI may mean a decrease in teaching aids and assistants.

AI technology will cause unemployment, The teachers will be replaced by robots, teachers may start movements and protests, There will be lack of personal engagement by replacing teachers with robots, but Educators are not “knowledge packs”, they present personal guidance, make an influence, and lead by example.

The power of Artificial Intelligence is in the hands of those who rule it, So, if someone can hack the code, he will gain the power to spread violent, inappropriate information and propaganda, The attention and the ability to multitask are reduced, We use so much help from machines that our own abilities shrink.



There are no alternative teaching methods, A good teacher can offer several ways to solve a particular problem, The teacher develops the flexibility of the student’s mind, but the robot will offer a standard solution with no alternative variants, AI widens the rich-poor gap, Bots and other AI learning tools will require a student to have a tablet or a laptop, but the government doesn’t fund all the technological implementations.

Kids’ ability to learn from a virtual assistant is still unclear, whether students will be invested in education and motivated enough to study when teachers are not there to supervise, Artificial intelligence comes with a high cost of installation, maintenance and repair, It is expensive, Only the most well-funded schools will find themselves in a position to benefit from AI.
